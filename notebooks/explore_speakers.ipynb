      "Thank you, Jeroen. Uh, actually the debate has already gone a long way in pointing out pitfalls and opportunities of low interest rate environment. I would start from Mario’s point, which, uh, should set, uh, framework for all policy decisions related to lower interest rates.\n",
      "\n",
      "That lower interest rates are not here for to stay forever. At some stage we will see some return to some normal state of- of the world, including interest rates that are a little bit higher at least.\n",
      "\n",
      "Uh, so this to me, uh, suggests that the lower interest rate environment should be seen [inaudible] what I like to call a window of opportunity. Christine already alluded to that in terms of [inaudible] a- a weaker euro, uh better inflationary expectations, and of course easier monetary provisions.\n",
      "\n",
      "And therefore the first- the first, uh, implication I would draw for policy is, uh, since there is a window of opportunity, which by definition will close up sooner than expected possibly, please let’s all not make the mistake of not exploiting that window of opportunity by pushing forward the [inaudible] programs that in many, our- our cases, certainly in my case if I may, uh, is very much at the center of the agenda.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a very general point, which does not relate to technicalities of the fiscal implications.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, this has been mentioned by both, and I will not dwell on it. But it’s very important. What can we do to, uh, help, uh, institutional investors do better in such an environment?\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course the assumption that these low rates will go away at some stage, will have to impact on long term investment decisions. So it’s not just, uh, it’s not that straight forward how, what are the implications for institutional investors? Although I very much subscribe to the view that more, uh… a larger choice set, let me put it that way. A larger choice set should be allowed to these investors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having said that, but then Pierre pointed out very clearly, of course the lower interest rates come along with an environment, where nominal growth, both nominal and real growth are lower, and inflation is also, uh, not high enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "So from that point of view, of course the impact on public finance of- of, uh, nom- a low nominal growth en- en- environment, has other implications. One must mention that- that it has caused an implication on revenues, which themselves would be lower.\n",
      "\n",
      "And this of course, uh, adds to the environment as, uh, the benchmark against which we have to assess. But also another point maybe worth mentioning, that while we have lower interest rates on- on government debt for a number of reasons, it is not always obvious to what extent this is transmitted to other interest rates in the market, to what extent there is a channel [inaudible] in terms of easier financial conditions or not. This may work both ways. But, uh, it’s also important to, uh, to take that into account.\n",
      "\n",
      "Coming to the point that was central in the presentation very quickly, uh, what should we do with that space that is generated by lower nominal, uh, interest rates?\n",
      "\n",
      "A- apart from measurement problems, how do we exactly measure the additional fiscal space generated by lower rates? Which has to do with the well known problems of measuring the impact, uh, on, uh, uh, uh, w- what is the cyclical impact? What is the impact of cyclical conditions on potential output, uh, coming from that, uh, just, uh, [inaudible 00:17:18]?\n",
      "\n",
      "I want to conclude with, uh, two lessons that I would, uh, draw. One, uh… Actually three lessons. One is, uh, yes that, uh, the, uh, amount of resources, uh, freed up by that window, should, uh, be devoted to, uh, making your fiscal stance stronger.\n",
      "\n",
      "Uh, which however can be seen in a number of ways. Not only, uh, uh, not only, uh, moderating your spending, but also modifying the composition of your spending towards more capital investment, which in many cases is complementary to the structure [inaudible 00:17:58].\n",
      "\n",
      "And of course I very much subscribe to [inaudible 00:18:02], uh many times [inaudible] the point that we, uh, we need good projects rather than good money. I fully subscribe to that, and I keep saying it around the world [inaudible] quoting you if I may.\n",
      "\n",
      "Um, the other point, and I’m finished, is that there is, uh, and opportunity with lower interest rates to improve debt management. To take benefit of the immediate lower cost of funding for the budget. And so to, uh, reassess the structure of your funding, your- your debt management, which will be helpful once at some stage the interest rate environment will be higher.\n",
      "\n",
      "So this is an additional element we should be taking into account, into asking what can we do to use that space, in order to improve our fiscal sustainability? Thank you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Okay, uh, [inaudible 00:00:40] the main element which was uh, on discussion or actually reflect [inaudible 00:01:37] opposition of the program on [crosstalk 00:01:37] on prior action we had uh, very long discussions uh, with uh, different documents [inaudible 00:02:02] number of elements [inaudible 00:02:02] on pensions [inaudible 00:02:02] elements will be explaining more uh, different elements we have the discussion [inaudible 00:02:05] basically as you’ll see [inaudible 00:02:11] proposals there is a joint proposal of the institutions and we must just redirect what we [inaudible 00:02:19] the institutions are working [inaudible 00:02:23] together and [inaudible 00:02:25]. Duration of extension of the program uh, where [inaudible 00:02:42] as institutions we uh, we can’t extend the program for appeal [inaudible 00:02:48] financing. The same thing listing uh, program [inaudible 00:02:52] which means some uh, five months period well a stretch maybe uh six months period [inaudible 00:02:58] on nine months extension [inaudible 00:03:07] institutional financing. So uh, yeah that’s uh a brief o-overview where we are now, so unfortunately uh, we cannot know agreement, documents are there for ministers to see what is the position of uh, the institutions [inaudible 00:03:47].\n",
