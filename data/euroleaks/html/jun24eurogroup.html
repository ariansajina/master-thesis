<p class="speech">Thank you very much, Jeroen. Um, I can very happily confirm what Pierre has just indicated, which is that on the review of the prior action list, the three institutions are exactly on the same page. There&#8217;s no difference between us, and we are guided by the same principles. And I just want to remind all of us what the principles are, in order to meet the shortage that, uh, Mario has just identified. The actions have to be credible in what they deliver. They have to be least growth unfriendly in order to help the Greek economy forward. They need to be fiscally sustainable and they need to be fair. And all together it needs to add up. Thank you.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="speaker-name">Yanis Varoufakis</span> <span class="timestamp">(00:01:16)</span>:</p>
<p class="speech">Well, I, uh, agree with, uh, Pierre, Mario and Christine. In particular, Mario is spot on. The reason why the recession has deepened in the last months is, as Mario said, a combination of uncertainty and lack of credit. I would like to add to the causes of uncertainty, the fact that for a while now&#8230; I&#8217;m not going to specify the period of time&#8230; it is not clear to investors, it is not clear to consumers, it is not clear to citizens in Greece, uh, how the, um, debt sustainability, which is absolutely necessary in order to remove uncertainty can be established under the present circumstances with the program that we&#8217;ve had so far. This is something that we have to be very careful about in, uh, um, planning, designing into the agreement, which we are all very, uh, we are all w- working very hard towards.</p>
</div>
<div class="intervention">
<p class="speaker"><span class="speaker-name">Yanis Varoufakis</span> <span class="timestamp">(00:02:19)</span>:</p>
<p class="speech">Uh, the four principles that Christine outlined, uh, credible actions, growth friendly policies, fiscally sustainable, uh, arrangements, and fairness are the ones that are also our top priorities. And I&#8217;m pleased also to report that the discussions that have been happening today, yesterday, all these days, are frank, they are very, uh, intense. I think that we&#8217;ve reached the point when we are talking about exactly what needs to be talked about. And we hope that, uh, the work that&#8217;s going to be put in by everyone&#8230; And I would like to thank everyone who&#8217;s putting the work into these discussions&#8230; is going to produce the fruits that, uh, we all want to see produced, and that tomorrow&#8217;s Eurogroup is going to [crosstalk] seal a mutually beneficial agreement.

<p class="speech">[inaudible] I think we have a very clear assignment which was put down by you in the first statement of the 20th of February. And I&#8217;m determined not to come back to you with proposals that do not comply with that agreement. Where we are now, we cannot present such proposals. [crosstalk] So in terms of process, uh, my proposal would be and has been, uh, strong, uh, conjunction with, uh, President Juncker, with Christine, with Mario [inaudible 00:04:07], that we continue work tonight with the Greeks [inaudible] the Greek, uh, delegations of course prepared to do so. We must ask you to stay, standby to continue this meeting tomorrow morning. But you can be assured that we will only come back to, with proposals to you, if they are in line with what we have outlined, the framework that we put in the second statement of the 20th of February. Over to you, Peter.</p>

</div>
<div class="intervention">
<p class="speaker"><span class="speaker-name">Luis de Guindos</span> <span class="timestamp">(00:05:06)</span>:</p>
<p class="speech">Uh, thank you, Jeroen. Uh, you know, in my, in my last intervention, uh, last, uh, Monday, I said very clearly that, uh, you know there is something that we should not do, is to create false expectations. Uh, well, we have seen the reaction of the market. Uh, tomorrow, I think that we will have, uh, you know, the inverse evolution and performance of the markets. I am not concerned about that. I am surely concerned about volatility the market plays, no, because, uh, I have suffered that, uh, uh, you know, as minister of finance of Spain, you know, in 2012, no? And I know what that does mean for, uh, you know, a government, and for a country. Uh, Mario, and, and Yanis agrees, has said that, you know, the two main problems that are causing, uh, the recession in Greece is the combination of uncertainty, and lack of credit.</p>
</div>
<div class="intervention">
<p class="speaker"><span class="speaker-name">Luis de Guindos</span> <span class="timestamp">(00:06:27)</span>:</p>
<p class="speech">Uh, well, uh, I think that it&#8217;s very clear that the combination of uncertainty and lack of credit can create a recession, but also can make a dent in the credibility of the solutions. I&#8217;m not, uh, concerned about, uh, you know, being convinced without, uh, you know, any definitive conclusion to a meeting like this. But I think that, uh, uh, it&#8217;s very important, it&#8217;s very important, not only for Greece, but, uh, for you know, all the ministers around this table and for our campus that we try to maintain, uh, certainty and, uh, credit. I think that, that&#8217;s extremely relevant.</p>

<div class="intervention">
<p class="speaker"><span class="speaker-name">Jeroen Dijsselbloem</span> <span class="timestamp">(00:07:21)</span>:</p>
<p class="speech">Thank you. First of all, I&#8217;d like to thank warmly the institutions for their hard work [inaudible] [crosstalk] for their hard work that will continue, I understand. Second point, you already anticipated, uh, I would like to plea that this group is convened, not just when there is a final solution, but when there is some probability of solution. This is not because, like everybody else, we&#8217;re a bit concerned about flying back and forth, which can be nice, but because there is an additional risk which I am beginning to spot, that the Eurogroup may lose credibility if we keep meeting without making progress. And of course, this, beyond a specific point we&#8217;re discussing today, is very important for the credibility of the, of the Eurozone going forward. My final point is about prior access. Uh, I fully share Christine&#8217;s list of features that should be, accompany prior actions, credible, fair, growth friendly, sustainable. Of course, prior actions are there to show, not just that, uh, a country is able to, uh, implement a policy that is needed, it is also willing to do so. Uh, as I said last time, we are badly running out of time, and we&#8217;re probably badly running out of trust, which is possibly even worse. So I will encourage, uh, that we, uh, reach the, reach an agreement, at least of prior actions, as a first step towards a, the deeper agreement.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="speaker-name">Wolfgang Schäuble</span> <span class="timestamp">(00:09:03)</span>:</p>
<p class="speech">I would first of all follow up to Luis when he said [inaudible] wrong expectations is dangerous. Of course, uh, sometimes markets are flying against the risk of increasing volatility &#8217;cause, uh, they might follow deceptions. Therefore, uh, I think we should be a little more careful. By the way, he might be right but when I followed a press conference after our last Eurogroup on Monday, I was a little bit surprised. And I, I, I have questioned myself as I have, uh, [inaudible] it was a little bit different because the atmosphere was [inaudible] in the press conference was much more [inaudible] the substance we have discussed in our Eurogroup [inaudible]. Second to Marcus, it&#8217;s fine but I don&#8217;t like because it&#8217;s never [inaudible] the contest was mentioned. I don&#8217;t like, really like, to, uh, extend [inaudible 00:09:50]. A little bit [inaudible] some of us have some other schedules as well. Well, believe it or not, but sometimes I have, uh, other obligations as well. [crosstalk] last week was nice, and I can&#8217;t stay four days and waiting until someone, who by the way is not the responsible one. Make some agreement [inaudible].</p>

<p class="speech">Okay, thanks, uh, Jeroen. Just one sort of observation/question on the process and then one quick comment on, on the substance. Just in the process, I mean, I, I of course find it exciting that I&#8217;ve been at three Eurogroups, uh, [inaudible] for six days. Uh, and, and, I was wondering how you plan to take this forward because what I see happening now is that, we&#8217;ll interrupt this meeting here, let the institutions of Greece work over a document, then we reconvene here in the morning. But I am not convinced, politically, that there will be a deal tomorrow morning, and perhaps&#8230; And this is more, uh, a question to Yanis&#8230; is there sort of a, some kind of guarantee that, uh, if your Prime Minister doesn&#8217;t wanna bring it up in the European Council one more time, which would then mean that we would probably have to reconvene on Friday evening?</p>

<div class="intervention">
<p class="speaker"><span class="speaker-name">Edward Scicluna</span> <span class="timestamp">(00:20:41)</span>:</p>
<p class="speech">Why do I say Friday evening? Because there needs to be a deal by Saturday morning, so that it can be then pushed, possibly, through the Greek parliament, so that it can then be approved by our parliaments. So that would basically mean that we would have, I don&#8217;t know, four, five, even six Eurogroups, within approximately eight days. Now, um, I don&#8217;t know, some people mentioned, and I think, correctly, the credibility, uh, of the Eurogroup, in, in, in this whole process and, and how we look. That&#8217;s one side of the story. The other side of the story is, is what Mario was talking about, basically market reaction because now we&#8217;re going back and, and, and forth. So I just wanted to ask you, Jeroen, how you plan to take it forward and also just some kind of a rain check from Yanis, on, on whether there is an attempt to push it one more time, uh, to the summit, uh, meeting, which I, I don&#8217;t think in and of itself would be helpful.

<p class="speech">Finally, on substance, I agree fully with what, for instance, Wolfgang said, uh, also what Hans Jörg said. I think we should stick to February 20. I think we need clear prior actions, we need commitments and, and conditionality. I don&#8217;t think that has changed. I&#8217;m just feeling [inaudible] you know, I have a feeling that we&#8217;re involved in a slightly surreal negotiation in the sense that the Euro working group is working on some kinds of decorations about an outcome, which they are not a part of the negotiation. And, and, you know, the, the Euro working group, uh, having read the report was, was extremely interesting, and the rest of it, but there&#8217;s a feeling that they are working on something that we don&#8217;t know the final outcome.

Um, since the, uh, February, we all agree that a lot of damage has been done to the, uh, Greek economy. Um, now, over the last week starting on Friday, with the events themselves, are putting into question our own credibility now. The ability of the Eurozone and the institutions [inaudible 00:23:22]. So we have to be really careful in, in delineating where we go from here, even about the meeting you have tomorrow. I think the litmus test of the negotiations tonight, shouldn&#8217;t be what Greece wants or what we want, and so on, but how are we going to be seen to the world outside?</p>

And, um, it&#8217;s a tall order, perhaps, to do, uh, during one night. But, um, we have to do that. And then we will do [inaudible] discuss, is it a good idea to say, &#8220;Let&#8217;s meet tomorrow,&#8221; because we can&#8217;t meet today because we don&#8217;t have the confidence.

<p class="speech">Thank you Jeroen. Um, I&#8217;m going to repeat other&#8217;s work but I think this issue of speaking consecutively to say that there is nothing substantial to discuss is really bad, uh, and when I was told that there would be a meeting today my first question was, &#8220;Is there enough time for a proposal to be discussed?&#8221; The answer I received was, &#8220;There has to be.&#8221; Ah, and the priority is not, and given that this has happened twice, I think it&#8217;s very [inaudible] to us that, uh, if it is reasonable to reconvene another meeting without the issue being discussed, decided, I think that on substance it has been said and repeated by many what is necessary to [inaudible] agreement, list of directions, um, a common position by the three institutions, all the preconditions in mind with the, uh, statement of February.</p>

And then there&#8217;s a summit in the afternoon, so I think we should really think whether it&#8217;s sensible to [inaudible] say that there will be a meeting tomorrow because, if there is, ready or not, there should be a decision no matter what.</p>

And if we get to an agreement at a later stage, and it&#8217;s clear to us whether this is final, whether we will reconvene again and decide something else, so I really urge for us to think whether it makes sense to meet tomorrow morning.

<p class="speech">Thank you Jeroen. Um, I will be very brief because I think most things have been said. Uh, but I underline that what is on the line here is, uh, obviously not only the problems that Greeks and the Greek governmental people have, but it&#8217;s the credibility of the Eurogroup and the credibility of the Eurozone and in the end credibility of the Euro. I have this strange feeling which we cannot even communicate to the outside world that we have basically not a lot, not a lot to say if not to say, nothing to say at all, because we don&#8217;t have documents in front of us.</p>

<p class="speech">This is not a criticism to the three institutions. I think they are doing a wonderful job. But the time has come where we we, we must know what&#8217;s on the table for the good sake of this negotiation. I think [inaudible] was alluding to it when he said, &#8220;There must be a time where the document comes to this table.&#8221; And, um, when you know, as Fontaine has mentioned it that quite a few countries cannot really give a go anyway without consulting their parliament or consulting, at least, I suppose, their Prime Minister, uh, which is my case. Uh, it is impossible to believe that if we continue tomorrow morning, and are confronted with document that we put on the table, where hopefully the three institution are going to tell us, &#8220;We think this, this is a good solution.&#8221; Then we still need to get back, and we [inaudible] in a minute.</p>

<p class="speech">And, last but not least, uh, I really think we need to be honest amongst ourselves to which extent we want to have a deal. So, in other words, what is the scope of the deal that we&#8217;re talking about? Are we talking about, what I call the very short term deal, which deals with problems of liquidity and finishing the, the program, and just prolonging it for a, for a few weeks so that we can do the payments? Is that what we are expecting tomorrow, or whenever? Or are we expecting something larger. So if we are expecting something larger, then obviously the answer is, we are in no position to, to, to give any green light to anything that requests additional money.</p>

It&#8217;s all short-term solutions, which we need. And other issues are postponed for later or are not discussed yet. But I would like enough clarity on this last point because, if we are still hoping, or some are still hoping, that we&#8217;re going to have something that goes beyond the very short term, I&#8217;m pretty sure there is no way we can find a solution.</p>

It&#8217;s becoming embarrassing that we&#8217;re relying on media leaks for the base documents, um, this Eurogroup is supposed to make decisions. We generated the document of the 20th of February ourselves, and that&#8217;s the only legal document that I have agreed to so far. We had one more, which was the subject of much speculation, and there were legal reasons why it wasn&#8217;t circulated, and I appreciate those legal reasons, but the aide-memoire has become a document on which a counter document from Greece has been made. And it has gone on now, seemingly, to become the basis for a negotiating document, uh, which I haven&#8217;t seen or which I do [inaudible] on the website [laughter] with another copy in the Financial Times website, uh, where the amendments proposed by the institutions are in red print and the base documents are in black print and there are 96 other amendments. I don&#8217;t know whether that means they&#8217;re no longer being pressed or whether they&#8217;ve been agreed by our finance ministers, who are key to the decision making process. This is no way to do business. And, uh, in the morning, I expect full documents because I&#8217;m not prepared to make decisions on narratives, no matter how, uh, succinct and full the narratives are.

In my books [inaudible] documents and, uh, [inaudible 00:39:02]. Basically, it seems clear that I see enormous advantage [inaudible] in, ah, [inaudible] and I have, there are two points of confusion [crosstalk 00:39:14]. We all agree our main purpose is to get the Greek economy back on its feet. I don&#8217;t exactly see how you can do that by doing something that&#8217;s so heavily based on, uh, [inaudible 00:39:27], especially when, uh, with the job description [inaudible 00:39:32] social contributions come from. And secondly, will all due respect to Yanis for what you say, what we have seen in the past is that, uh, exploration clearly is a problem.

First, thinking about the substance, where we are [inaudible] I would say scarce information that we got in the past and that we could, uh, collect from the media. Actually I agree, if we give Greece sustainably, uh, be sustainable, such as the economy in the future the, the key growth from these, from those items or the changes that will be made to have increase growth [crosstalk] and the only thing that I see for growth [crosstalk] was the very, um, I would say politically expressed request for [inaudible 00:41:24].</p>

I would like to see structural reforms in lending market, in product market, I would like to have, to see, you know, where there would be the support to grow.

Of course in previous meetings a number of you colleagues have said you refuse to be involved, be involved more, which is a quite right point because of developments followed through the media. If we hadn&#8217;t met to discuss. Now we are meeting more often than we would like, to be involved. The difficulty is that there are no final results to present to you. So there is a dilemma here. Um, how has the process evolved? I think Michael described it in quite a good way, how the different documents have been following each other up. Documents which you have not had.

<p class="speech">Looking back, ah, last couple of weeks, uh, three institutions have worked on a common position, and after that agreed to present it for the first time, quite a comprehensive set of proposals, at nine pages. Which was a positive step, as opposed to how we discussed it here. Also we realized that the institutions had not been able to give a more thorough assessment of those proposals to see how close they were to the framework which we agreed. That work has been done over the last couple of days. At the same time, the Greek authorities have presented a list of prior actions. Not only did we, the institutions, come to the assessment that there were still a number of problems in the nine pages, to answer Gutchen, these problems are along the line fiscal gaps, so the Greek authorities said they could agree to the proposed, by the institutions proposed, not agreed by us yet. But by the institutions proposed new fiscal targets and timelines. The authorities have said we could agree to those. But then the methods have to add up to those. So there were fiscal gaps.</p>

<p class="speech">Secondly, the analysis of three institutions jointly was that in terms of credible reforms, where does the growth come from? It&#8217;s not [inaudible] too much has been reversed, or postponed, not complete enough. It will not lead to enough growth.</p>

<p class="speech">Thirdly, the balance in the package that we were discussing, the balance between, ah, tax increase, expenditure cuts, once again growth harming tax increases was too much of a tax hike. So it needs to become more growth friendly, or less growth unfriendly. So these are the main problems that we are [crosstalk] that we are, um, so the nine page proposal from the Greek government was assessed and showed these problems. A list of prior actions then proposed by the Greek government deviate, deviated even more from where we want to end.</p>

<p class="speech">That must be the case. Today we have gone through these proposals. Um, we have not been able to close that gap. *I&#8217;ve listened* very carefully to you today, and have reaffirmed the statement of the 20th. Absolutely clear that we cannot diverge from it. You have made clear that, uh, the current situation can be no talk of debt restructuring, etcetera. Uh, Wolfgang added there can be no additional money. No fresh money. Very clear. That&#8217;s the basis that we must work on in order to propo- to bring to you proposals that are valid. That have a chance of getting your approval. It takes a lot more time than, uh, we would like. It&#8217;s getting a lot more media coverage than is helpful. And it is putting a great strain on your agendas, ah, to which I apologize, ah, but this is where we are. Now on the issue of tomorrow, I think there are two options. We can say that we adjourn temporarily this meeting and reopen it tomorrow. We can also say that only on the basis of what is there tomorrow, we will call a new meeting. But some of you would have said that you would also like to be informed, and maybe talk about different scenarios if there is no agreement.</p>

<p class="speech">So, we&#8217;ve been assigned to the government leaders in the council to try to, try and get that agreement, and then report to them tomorrow. That is still the assignment that we have. I think we should give an ultimate attempt, tonight, all through the night, to try and get the convergence that we need. To land inside the framework of the 20th. That is how I see our task in the coming hours, ultimate attempt to do that. I c- would like to ask you to stay in Brussels and be available so we can continue our work. I think that would be wise more-so as a signal to the outside world that we are still in the process. Uh, but I would need your support. It would have to be a common decision of all of us. Um, ah, I think it was Pierre who said we would need some hours to look at any proposals. We need to prepare, and I think that&#8217;s a fair point. So we could set our meeting perhaps later in the morning, so you have that time, under the assumption that over the course of the night we hammer out all the differences that are still there.</p>

<p class="speech">I am in this space very strongly involved. I vouch for the institutions, the work that they are doing, jointly. Their analysis of where we are, and the Greek proposals has been the same between the three of them. The adjustments that we need has been delivered by the three institutions together. I think this is very important. I will remain very involved over the coming hours and days. But unfortunately, this is where we are and I think it is inevitable that between now and the summit, which starts tomorrow afternoon at 5:00, to which we have to report, that you remain available, either to take stock, hopefully, of good proposals, concrete papers that you have asked. Michael has made quite clear he needs those papers to come to any decision. Or to take stock the situation if not. Because I think it was [inaudible] he also needs to talk if there is no agreement tomorrow. I think we have to take our responsibility however inconvenient this is.</p>

And, uh, again, uh, the uni- well, the question of credibility while dinner is on the table, I am not going to insist any more to reiterate what I have said. But I think that we should need a line of communication and to try to explain why, two days ago, we were sanguine with respect to the possibility of reaching an agreement and today this possibility has faded away.

<p class="speech">Oh, ah, from the Greek side, as well, we would prefer to have the meeting, to hold the meeting as late in the day as possible, to give us more time to prepare. So I agree with most colleagues who have spoken on this. Ah, allow me to say that, ah, on the question of, ah, growth-friendly policies, since this has been mentioned and this is central to the issue at hand, my government is absolutely committed to them. But let me make the brief point that when you have a shrinking economy and we agree on two and half percent of GDP of extra measures. This is not in itself a particularly growth-friendly ah, posture. The difference of opinion is empirical. It&#8217;s not ideological. Do you get greater forces of recession by reducing the pensions of the lowest of the low of pensions, or do you get more recession when you increase tax on corporate tax? This is an empirical issue. This is not a dogmatic issue.</p>

We have tabled our own version. Our own proposal and prior actions. It&#8217;s a question of coming to an agreement with the institutions on this. On the broader question, let me say colleagues that we feel, just like you do, perhaps more than you do, the pressure to end this conversation successfully to complete the review as quickly as possible. We more than you, for obvious reasons. But let me also add that maybe it is better to have the sequence of, ah, tedious meetings, than to have a situation where we hatch up an agreement which is not sustainable and which leads all of us to come back to this room six months, eight months, nine months, 12 months from now. That would harm the credibility of the institutions and the Eurogroup and each one of us even more.</p>

<p class="speech">Let me make two points before I turn to Pierre. First of all, the leaders in their meeting were absolutely clear that they will not endorse any outcome if the Eurogroup has not previously agreed to it. So if anyone dreams of getting a deal in the European Council, or in a leaders&#8217; summit, they are mistaken. The only thing the leaders can do, and will do, is send it back to the Eurogroup.

There needs to be time to commit, to examine the eventual result, uh, of this negotiation. There needs also to be time for us to deliberate here, and deliver, because, best case scenario, I think the only scenario, is that the leaders enter the meeting on the basis of an agreement that we reach here. So [inaudible] we&#8217;ll have to choose what is the right timetable that is a few hours to examine the possible agreement. There is also some time here to find an agreement and to say there is an agreement so that you can go in [inaudible] council with this agreement. [inaudible] do what you have to do.
