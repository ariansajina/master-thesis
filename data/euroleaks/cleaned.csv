speaker 2,"uh, yes, uh, thank you, jeroen. well, uh, commission, uh, has, uh, carefully reviewed the reformed proposal sent yesterday to the, uh, president of eurogroup. and, uh, this has been preceded by, uh, contractual exchanges, uh, over the weekend between the, between the greek authorities and, uh, european commission, and also other, uh, institutions. so, in the review of the commission, this list is sufficiently comprehensive to be a valid starting point for a successful conclusion of the review as called for by the eurogroup at it’s last, uh, meeting. let me stress, uh, however, that the list does not include sufficient detail to allow us to assess each specific measure, and how that impacts on a budget, or on the overall program targets. further specification of the reforms in this and other key areas, uh, is expected to be provided and agreed before the end of april. this is also in line with last week’s, uh, eurogroup, uh, statement. uh, we consider the eurogroup statement of the last friday as a basis.",1900-01-01 00:00:10,2015-02-24 00:00:00

speaker 3,has entered the conference.,1900-01-01 00:01:33,2015-02-24 00:00:00
speaker 2,"… that the letter by the minister does not, uh, directly to refer to the commitments in this, uh, statement, such as, for example, to deliver primary surpluses and financing proceeds  to guarantee that sustainability in line with november 2012 eurogroup statement. uh, we also find it rather unusual that the letter is not formally signed and does not refer to any actual government decision in this context. so the legal status of the letter is therefore not fully, uh, clear. uh, importantly, this list does not substitute in any views, uh, memorandum of understandings, which constitutes the official legal basis for the program underpinning the master financial assistance facility agreement. it is also important to recall that the greek authorities are permitted to refrain from any rollback of measures and unilateral changes to the policies and structural reforms that would negatively impact fiscal targets, economic recovery or financial stability as assessed by the institutions.",1900-01-01 00:01:37,2015-02-24 00:00:00
speaker 2,"uh, any policy initiatives therefore, should be discussed ex-ante with the three institutions. and now i would ask pierre to, uh, elaborate further on some critical, uh, details.",1900-01-01 00:02:48,2015-02-24 00:00:00
pierre moscovici,"um, okay colleagues. um, in general i would say we are encouraged by a number of commitments in  consider at all times the new government must, uh, take, uh, immediate visible steps to show determination for change in these areas. believe a revision of the legal framework is, uh, needed.",1900-01-01 00:02:59,2015-02-24 00:00:00

speaker 3,has entered the conference.,1900-01-01 00:04:00,2015-02-24 00:00:00
pierre moscovici,"… urgent deferential and immediate decisions ought to be taken, uh, as the uncertainty of the past weeks has been, um, damaging and destructive. first, in the financial sector we believe the government must reiterate as soon as possible, in a very clear manner, uh, that key pillars of reform as agreed under the mou, uh, to settle the markets and diplomatics. uh, similarly, um, taxation and installments, the government must take urgent action, uh, to clarify it’s intentions, so that taxpayers begin to pay again taxes and social security contributions. and decisions should be taken, uh, swiftly in a full, uh, consultation with these three institutions.",1900-01-01 00:04:02,2015-02-24 00:00:00
pierre moscovici,"uh, second, on privatization, um, our feeling is that the government should instruct the agency to proceed with the ongoing standards also swiftly. so, the commission, uh, looks forward to, to, to, to working with the new administration to, to elaborate what are, are still at the moment general commitments, and transform these into, uh, clear policy actions. we would also like to underline our willingness to continue to provide, uh, technical assistance in key areas, to, to assist in the design and, and the implementation of policies. uh, to sum up, i won’t be longer, in the view of the commission, this is, is sufficiently comprehensive to be, uh, a valid starting point for a successful conclusion of the review. it is not at all something that means that the review is concluded or on the way to be concluded, and i think this was, uh, what we were asked by the eurogroup, and our answer is clear on that point.",1900-01-01 00:04:42,2015-02-24 00:00:00
jeroen dijsselbloem,"thank you very much, uh, as always, pierre. uh, let me turn to the uh, ecb. mario?",1900-01-01 00:05:44,2015-02-24 00:00:00
mario draghi,"yes, thanks jeroen. thank you. as, uh, as we discussed the… in such short time, was certainly not possible for the authorities to come up with their own list of complete proposals and commitments, which would allow us, the institutions, but especially ecb to assess the impact on growth, public finances and financial stability. i note that the commitments outlined by the authorities differ from existing program commitments in a number of areas. but having said that, the list sent by the greek authorities covers a wide range of reform areas, and in this sense it’s appreciably comprehensive to be a valid starting point for a successful conclusion of the review.",1900-01-01 00:05:50,2015-02-24 00:00:00
mario draghi,"now, let me make a few additional remarks. we understand consistently with the eurogroup decision last friday, that the list doesn’t call into question that the current arrangement, and asks existing commitments in the current mou and mefp are the basis for the review. in cases where the list deviates from the mefp and the mou, we will assess during the review, where the measures which are not accepted by the authorities are replaced with measures of equal or better quality in terms of achieving the objectives of the program. we would appreciate if the greek authorities would make very clear and public that there will be no rolling back of existing reforms or commitments in any of the areas mentioned in their list. any new measures or laws in these areas will only be implemented once agreed with the three institutions. unfortunately we still continue to hear conflicting messages between the communication to the greek general public and the comit- and the commitments to this group.",1900-01-01 00:06:40,2015-02-24 00:00:00
mario draghi,"second point concerns the payment culture. the list we are discussing today was not used for this purpose. in the coming days, we would expect very clear statements from the highest levels. the concern is to previous announcements. first, there will be no initiatives by the government on broadening or relaxing installment schemes, and the measures to strengthen tax enforcement and payment discipline will urgently be discussed with the three institutions. unfortunately, even this morning, we are hearing conflicting message from athens.",1900-01-01 00:08:03,2015-02-24 00:00:00
mario draghi,"second, there would be no new moratorium on auctioning of residences, nor any other restrictions, which makes it difficult for banks to effectively work out the ntls. i think it should be in the interest of greece, first and foremost, to have a viable credit system. if banks are not viable, they won’t give any credit. i made this point several times.",1900-01-01 00:08:41,2015-02-24 00:00:00
mario draghi,"there will also be no initiative for any general or horizontal debt relief for private creditors. i mean, jerome, with your agreement i would like to make a point on the difference between the eurogroup statement and uh, this, uh, the statement here about the  bonds for bank recapitalization. can i make it now?",1900-01-01 00:09:03,2015-02-24 00:00:00
jeroen dijsselbloem," bonds, uh, would take place. it would be… it would take place on the basis of the ecb ssm decision. they are the ones who trigger the use of these funds, uh, for recapitalization purposes. uh, that’s what we agreed in eurogroup. uh, any further debate on that issue, i think, should be… should take place in the euro working group, if that’s all right.",1900-01-01 00:09:25,2015-02-24 00:00:00
mario draghi,"thank you, jeroen. so i… i understand as the draft amendment of the master financial assistance facility agreement that has circulated yesterday will be in line with the statements agreed on friday.",1900-01-01 00:10:11,2015-02-24 00:00:00
jeroen dijsselbloem,"yes. and if anyone has any further comments on that, then i think it should take place in the euro working group, uh-",1900-01-01 00:10:26,2015-02-24 00:00:00
mario draghi,"okay. thank you. then for me, if i have this assurance there is no need to raise this point. thank you. then i’m finished.",1900-01-01 00:10:33,2015-02-24 00:00:00
wolfgang schäuble,"sorry, may i, may i… jeroen, can i take this ?",1900-01-01 00:10:41,2015-02-24 00:00:00
jeroen dijsselbloem,"yes, please.",1900-01-01 00:10:48,2015-02-24 00:00:00
wolfgang schäuble,"uh, i would be… uh, uh, it must be totally clear, because i will cr- it will create, uh, in- incredible problems in my parliament. we have in, in no way any amendment through the given agreement. we have stated in… on, on, on friday, um, onto the . therefore, my, my, my, my demand is only don’t create the discussion or misunderstandings that there will be any amendment, uh, to the, to the given agreement.",1900-01-01 00:10:49,2015-02-24 00:00:00
jeroen dijsselbloem,"um, don’t worry uh, wolfgang, there will be no changes or amendments to the statement we, we saw friday. in that particular sentence, there are two aspects. one is, as you said that it’s… the release of these funds will be on request by the ssm, but you could also read they will be released on request by the ssm. in other words, formally, there may be a decision to be taken, um, but they will be released on request by the ssm. in other words, if the ssm finds it necessary, this recapitalization, the funds will be released. so there are both aspects in one sentence. um, we’re not going to change the statement, that would cause a lot of problems of course. uh, if anyone wants further clarification, i think it should take place in the euro working group. it’ll be about procedures, but not about the political decision we took.",1900-01-01 00:11:49,2015-02-24 00:00:00
jeroen dijsselbloem,"if, um, i may be continue, i would like to, uh, ask, uh, christine, for her assessment.",1900-01-01 00:12:45,2015-02-24 00:00:00
christine lagarde,"thank you very much, jerome and good afternoon to all of you. i will not repeat the content of the letter that we issued last night. i could, uh, literally endorse and exalt all the points made by mario, except the last one, which is quite separate. the two points i will come back to to insist upon, is number one, that the discussions on completion of the review, which should start as soon as possible, and for which we are ready, to be successful, can not be merely confined within the policy parameters outlined in the government list. and i think the reference to the mou and the nesp by mario was particularly relevant.",1900-01-01 00:12:55,2015-02-24 00:00:00
christine lagarde,"the second concern that i have, which was also mentioned by mario, is the constant and recurring noise that we hear from athens, and which echo around the world in a way that is inconsistent with what is indicated in the memorandum of the list issued by the greek authorities. and there is real constant reference to backtracking. that includes expectation of im- impending changes to the pension scheme that backtrack on policy commitments, as well as changes to the general tax, uh debt installment fees, that already have, uh, weakened, uh, the revenue collection by the greek authorities. so, yanis, if you would, with us on the call, i would urge you to reduce that noise and make very clear that there is one single list and not a greek list separate from your list.",1900-01-01 00:13:45,2015-02-24 00:00:00
christine lagarde,"finally, i think it could be extremely helpful, certainly from our perspective, if, uh, yanis could explain to all of us the government’s current liquidity position, as well as how it is proposed to move forward. with that, as i said, uh, we stand ready, and we’re eager to, uh, begin the real work, which will not be about putting, uh, words on, on paper, which will, we’re not associated to over the weekend, but that’s fine. but clearly, the actual review work now needs to begin. thank you.",1900-01-01 00:14:53,2015-02-24 00:00:00
jeroen dijsselbloem,"thank you christine. um, i would now like to turn to yanis to pick up on a couple of points raised. uh, i think we all fully understand that the detailed work has yet to begin. uh, and we must all fully understand that all the legal documents and the basis for the program of support is unchanged until further, um, works out, details discussed and agreed with the institutions. so that’s the basis on which we, uh, work. uh, yanis, can i ask you to react on the couple of issues raised by, uh, mario and the commission, uh, christine?",1900-01-01 00:15:23,2015-02-24 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"yeah, sure. thank you so much, uh, jeroen. let me… how i would begin by thanking, um, you, as the president of the eurogroup, for your role in helping establish the necessary common ground to reach where we are at present. i also want, want to thank the institutions for, uh, um, the constructive relationship we had over the last 48 hours, and for so swiftly reading our list and coming to the verdict or the recommendation that you have come. i do believe, and the government believes, here in athens, that we now have a firm basis on which to build a solid agreement, and, uh… for the next four months at least, and, uh, work towards, uh, the review. let me now, uh, do as, uh, you said jerome, and address, uh, some specific issues that were mentioned.",1900-01-01 00:16:09,2015-02-24 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"um, there are some minor issues which we can deal with very, very swiftly. that the letter wasn’t signed, it was sent at midnight, so, um, there were technical issues involved there, but we can deal with that. this is a response to one of the commissions points. um, the question of no unilateral moves, and the need to collaborate with institutions in everything we do has been mentioned by all three institutions. i shall convey this view to my government. it is our in- intention not to make any such moves, as we have stated in our letter to the eurogroup. we have, uh, every intention to collaborate with institutions and to make sure whatever we introduce in parliament and whatever measures are, um, discussed and deployed, uh, should be discussed and deployed in conjunction with agreement with institutions.",1900-01-01 00:17:04,2015-02-24 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"pierre moscovici mentioned, uh, elstat, the greek statistics office, and suggested there should be no revision of the legal, um, framework and the autonomy. we understand perfectly well the need not to return to the bad old days of greek statistics, and we as a government have absolutely no intention whatsoever of interfering with the work of elstat. but let me say that this kind of autonomy has to cut both ways, in the sense that both eurostat, and the greek government, and every member state and all the institutions must have, um, confidence in the workings of elstat. at the moment, i cannot tell you that i do. that is a separate issue from, uh, keeping elstat at an arms length from government. what i would like to do is discuss with institutions and with eurostat, ways in which we can regain confidence in elstat.",1900-01-01 00:18:06,2015-02-24 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"but that is completely separate from the point that pierre moscovici made. i shall reiterate the point. we shall under no circumstances, uh, do anything to jeopardize the autonomy of elstat, uh, and we shall do nothing without the consent of the commission of the imf, of the ecb, uh, of the eurogroup in this direction. but i do believe, this is the view that some of us in this government have, who’ve looked into the operation of elstat over the last few months, that we need, uh, for all of us together to have another at the way that elstat functions. uh, but again, let me make this very clear, this is not something we intend to do alone. we want to do it in conjunction with you.",1900-01-01 00:19:11,2015-02-24 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"regarding the financial sector and tax compliance, this is a point that each one of you made, each one of the institutions made, um, there is, um, lack of trust regarding installment schemes. let me remind you that this installment scheme that is now on the statutes in… here in greece, was introduced by the previous government. and i do believe that, uh, the institutions had, uh, objections to that. we are happy to look at these, uh, installment schemes together with our… with, with institutions and with all our partners. there is a very crucial problem here. th- th- th- th- the level of arrears, uh, tax arrears, as you probably all know reaches 90 percent of the greek government budget. now that is a huge amount that has to do with… is a result of the deep crisis of this, uh, social economy. and we need to deal with this, and we need to deal effectively with it by ensuring that whatever it is that we do does not encourage, indeed, punishes strategic non-payment, while at the same time finds ways of dealing with dealing, of giving those who can afford to pay a portion only of what they owe a way of doing this, especially given the current state of our financial situation.",1900-01-01 00:19:52,2015-02-24 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"um, on the npls, and i take very seriously what mario draghi and the ecb are saying about the need to, um, ensure that the capitalization of banks is not threatened by, uh, our policies regarding, um, npls. again, it is important to note that we have very special circumstances in greece, which i’ll not do… make any, um, uh, unilateral move on this, and of course we need to have the backing of the ecb in everything we do.",1900-01-01 00:21:13,2015-02-24 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"but let me…since we are talking about this, let me point that, that there are special circumstances. we have a realistic market that has tanked and the notion that we are going to have options of first residences in order to bolster the capitalization of the banks is one that, uh, that needs to be discussed. and, uh, we need to discuss it with you. this is not the venue to do it. but there are serious worries that a massive increase in auctions, uh, in the tanking market is not going to help the banks while at the same time is going to create side-effects in the capacity of the social economy, both to increase, uh, the tax take of the government, and, uh, to increase economic activity. but let me say that, uh, this government is determined to discuss with institutions and arrange common agreement with them on how to deal with these, with these matters.",1900-01-01 00:21:49,2015-02-24 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"now, on the question that mario draghi raised regarding the fsf and the hfsf, uh, let me just state that, um, for the record to rest everyone… um, rest assure everyone that this government is not going to request for an amendment of the friday eurogroup agreement. um, we are more than happy to go along with that agreement, and to see the fsf retain the control of the remaining funds, in order to use them for the purposes of recapitalization of the banking sector and resolution, possible resolution. uh, on the, on the question of, uh, a rollback, especially when it comes to privatizations, um, on this matter, as you will see from our… from the relevant entry in our list, we have, uh, made it very clear that completed, uh, um, completed, uh, privatizations are going to be considered to be sacrosanct from this government. the ones that have been launched will be dealt with in accordance to the law, and in ways that, uh, combine the public interest with the need, the necessity of collaborating with institutions and with the eurogroup.",1900-01-01 00:22:47,2015-02-24 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"let me finish by, uh, addressing christine lagarde’s two points. the first one is an assurance that i can give christine and everybody in this conference call that there exists no separate greek list, separate from the one you have. of course, as you can imagine, our… this list is only, uh, a five page document. uh, we have, uh, um a series of, uh, commitments to the greek public. we shall not make any moves, as i said before, that, uh, undermine the bonds of trust that we are trying to build currently. um, but there is no such thing as a separate greek list. there may be different interpretations of, uh, the current, uh, state of negotiation, of exchange between us, of commitment. and let me just make this t- t- this point a bit more tangible.",1900-01-01 00:24:07,2015-02-24 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"i heard from all three institutions the statement that, um, this list is not a replacement of the mou, and that this list is going to simply being grafted upon the mou or we will have to negotiate ways in which the current mou will have to be amended. now, as you know, we’ve spent three eurogroups discussing the imperative of combining the existing program with, uh, the, the new government’s priorities. and i th- i have… i am… i was under the impression, and this government was under the impression that we are making a fresh start without challenging the legal existence of the mou.",1900-01-01 00:25:06,2015-02-24 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"we shall insist on maintaining, in a collegial manner, this constructive ambiguity, um, and we are going to try do, to do our, ou- our, our best in order to ensure that the review is completed, on the understanding that this governments, um, um, list that you have in front of you, is taken, um, as the starting point regarding th- th- the judgment that is going to be passed upon us over the next four months. the next four or five months is a very short space of time. if we can do what we agree that we should do by april, um, and do it in the spirit that con- that confirms both the existing program and the intention of moving on, and moving ahead, and moving to a new relationship after june, i think that will be an excellent way of moving ahead.",1900-01-01 00:25:51,2015-02-24 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"i was asked also by christine lagarde to explain the liquidity condition of the government. i’m not in a situa- in, in, in, uh, in a position to do this presently. uh, the… as you kn- as everybody knows, especially the international monetary fund, our liquid- liquidity condition given the destabilization of the greek economy over the last two months, uh, is not good at all. but my understanding was that today, what we are doing is we are setting the scene, establishing the base, the foundation, for beginning immediate discussions on all those matters including the fiscal cap that we are facing over the next few weeks, in particular, the repayments of the imf loans in installments, which are coming up soon. um, it was a discussion we couldn’t have until today’s hurdle has been overcome, but it is a discussion that we are prepared to begin even tonight, if you so wish.",1900-01-01 00:26:48,2015-02-24 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"um, i think i have spoken enough. i want to thank, once more, the institutions. the way i understand this conference call is to answer the question whether our list is sufficiently comprehensive to act as the starting point of a process that will stabilize greece and our relationship with, uh, the eurogroup and the institutions, in order to build trust and to move ahead. thank you.",1900-01-01 00:27:44,2015-02-24 00:00:00
jeroen dijsselbloem,"thank you, yanis. um, let me for, uh, opening, uh, the, the, the floor to other ministers. uh, we iterate that the basis that we are working on is the eurogroup statement which, um, uh, talks about on the base of the framework of the existing arrangements, uh, underpinned by a set of commitments which are then spelled out. and i think one of the key ones there is that starting from the current arrangement, there can be use of the given flexibility that had to be always after consulting and agreeing with the institutions any changes to the arrangements. i think that could… that clear issue, and you underlined the, um, uh… how the greek government is committed on this point.",1900-01-01 00:28:06,2015-02-24 00:00:00
jeroen dijsselbloem,"um, on top of that, we now have the list which is a third list of reform measures, based on the current arrangements and the institution that provided us with their first views, which, um, uh, was, if i summarize it, that the list is sufficiently comprehensive to be a valid starting point for a successful conclusion of the reissue. um, i think those are the key, uh, elements. this is where we are, this is how we will work, and all of this… if the national procedures are started and successfully, um, finished by the end of the week, then, very intensively, the work can start on many of the issues that were brought up, uh, and, um, many of the issues that you mentioned.",1900-01-01 00:28:59,2015-02-24 00:00:00

poul mathias thomsen,"okay so, i, i can be very brief erm, we think the process is highly unfinished actually. erm, we think it’s clear that the authorities are not really interested in engaging in discussion of the review. erm, it’s clear that they consider the mission mostly a nuisance erm, being there. erm, and erm, some of the communication highly inflammatory statements by officials about erm, the technical people that are there, are, are, are, simply not acceptable. erm, we’re not making progress erm, of erm, any significant progress erm, you know i, i, i assume that declan has gone into, into sufficient detail but this is not leading us towards concluding .",1900-01-01 00:12:10,2015-03-17 00:00:00

marco buti,"they uh, as other colleagues from the ecb or from the imf will confirm, have been patient and flexible, but i mean, we have to see see, and search again and again, that working methods are not efficient, in particular when one considers the extreme urgency of the situation. i think it is high time to focus on the substance and not the the form of the negotiations and it is imperative to step up the pace of these discussions. i mean, to resend, i think it’s important that the greek authorities need to ensure that the senior staff attend the technical meetings in athens with a clear mandate to  government and we need to cover all policy matters on the issue and i think not only some of the priorities, which are tabled by the authorities. um, i mean, they…. this is as far as, in general terms, a part of the meeting in athens uh, um, goal. the discussions in the brussels group were useful, but they essentially remain limited to the policy intention of the government and we are lacking the necessary details in almost all issues.",1900-01-01 00:04:59,2015-04-01 00:00:00
marco buti,"and we know that the main details matter, as without, without, sufficient uh, level of in-depth discussion and details, we simply cannot make a meaningful assessment on individual reforms. not uh, on the, on the package uh, as a whole. it is still not clear to us which measures the government is prepared to proceed with. and remember this, the 70 and the 30% divisions are prepared to proceed with so it will be formally part of the 70%, nor do we know what new measures are in the pipeline of… on the, on the, on the 70% less. i mean, based on discussions in the brussels group, there seems to be the potential to common ground on a number of issues, including here the revision of the income tax code, the uh, the code of code, the modernization of the judicial system. measures to tackle tax evasion and improve the vat collection. creating an independent tax administration. removing unnecessary barriers to competition and making it easier to do business.",1900-01-01 00:06:38,2015-04-01 00:00:00

marco buti,"i think it is unacceptable that people, that people with low income cannot afford to service the mortgage will be made homeless. so, this um… i think there’s a need to square this to objective by enabling banks to threaten to seize the assets of people with high income and also by ensuring that there is a functioning social safety uh, safety net. i mean, we uh, strongly urge the institutions to develop a targeted piece to protect the vulnerable in the society, including by uh, means-testing. um, and there is no need to have a blanket extension on the moratoria on the foreclosure of primary, uh, primary residencies, nor there is a need to have an  for the payment of back taxes that is unrestricted with large debts up to one million euro.",1900-01-01 00:09:35,2015-04-01 00:00:00
marco buti,"i mean, these policies… i mean, actually they run against the stated objective. they de facto favour the rich and punish the honest citizens with taxes. now, the policy intentions are uh… as i indicated, not only in a number of instances unclear, but we continue to face cases of back-tracking. for instance, we remain concerned that the position of the national anti-corruption code has been de facto  of the privatization process has been substantially scaled back, which clearly has implications for the dac, but also negative implications of competitive and fdi going forward. i mean, even if reforms are not planned for the near future, we need to have clarity on government intention regarding the system of minimum wage and collective bargaining.",1900-01-01 00:10:42,2015-04-01 00:00:00

benoît cœuré,"so, that’s certainly uh, very good. um, let me uh, say however, that we are still at an early stage of the work, i would need that to conclude the review. um, a number of, a number of policy intentions and initiatives by the government go in the right direction, which is very welcome. it is very relative that the authorities express a strong commitment to tackle corruption and vested interests in the greek society and any step in that direction will have our staunchest support. uh, that is most needed. uh, many of these policy intentions, however, they remain relatively unspecific and as we all know, the devil normally lies in the details and so we look forward to work closely with the administration to design the policy plans. and the first step to understand that policy plan and then to discuss the details. so, that was a useful first stage, that we know how to go into more details to organize a number of areas, areas. also, for us to be in a position to provide a costing uh, of these different measures. we appreciate the numbers that were sent by the uh, by the greek authorities, but the role of the three institutions is to be able to, to, to check the numbers.",1900-01-01 00:17:02,2015-04-01 00:00:00
benoît cœuré,"perform a judgment on the numbers and we’re not yet in a position to do that given the lack of details. and that, uh, and here the conclusion in terms of process is that it really lies in the uh, the pursuit of the discussions in athens at a technical level. um, as marco has already said, uh, we have to note that a number of proposals here clearly uh, run counter to the current program and its objectives. this is not only about the labor market and the tax policies where there are obviously differences, but also in other fields, and as we, as we’ve already said in previous discussions and meetings, um, it is problematic that the authorities have proceeded to legislate in several areas uh, even before the discussion had started. uh, and that includes the installment flow, the dismantling of the national anti-corruption coordinator, uh, and the transfer away from the  tax administration, which all go uh, uh, counter to the objective of either improving the governance of the tax system and/or even of improving the fairness of the system.",1900-01-01 00:18:27,2015-04-01 00:00:00
benoît cœuré,"and that’s related in particular to the installment law which is extremely generous and covers a number of households which clearly don’t have problems paying their taxes. um, we um, uh, in terms of the speed of the process, as marco said, we really are at a point where we need to speed up the process if we want to achieve the objective that we agreed in the eurogroup meeting. we acknowledge the difficult  of the discussion in uh, in athens and brussels. and marco said that we’ve been… our colleagues have been in athens for three weeks, which is actually true, but the fact is that the, the, the real discussions in athens have started last friday.",1900-01-01 00:19:46,2015-04-01 00:00:00
benoît cœuré,"so, we have a record of four days of effective technical discussions in athens. so out of these three weeks, only four days were intense, uh, useful, uh, uh, grinding out technical discussions in athens. and that’s another thing that… so if we go in that direction, it is not enough. um, the um, moving to the um… moving to the financial issues, uh,  around 107 billion euros and remember that the starting point was early december, 45 million euros, and it’s now 107 billion euros reliance of the central bank money.",1900-01-01 00:21:00,2015-04-01 00:00:00

benoît cœuré,"that’s also very important for financial stability. um, as a conclusion, let me say that uh, there are often references to these discussions to the ecb either reinstating the waiver or lifting the . that is a decision that will be taken by the governing council, including governance, and they have the advancement of the discussion and what the governing council will need to see to take a decision is a credible perspective of a successful conclusion of the review. so, what we’re discussing here is do we see a perspective of a successful conclusion as a review and the existing arrangement? meaning that this not only about the pace of the discussion, but also, the breadth of the discussion. this is about potentially, ultimately, concluding the review, which is about covering the full range of the arrangement. um, so that is uh, what we want to uh, to see and also what we want to hear from the ewb before the governing council of the ecb can attempt to discuss it in a meaningful way. i stop here for now.",1900-01-01 00:25:20,2015-04-01 00:00:00

nikos theocarakis,"at the second level, when we got specific question, we had, in actuality, an info glass. we were flooded with information that our people, and to be frank, our young government, could not answer to your heart’s content. so, communication was indeed suboptimal, but i think that recently, we have found a way to work in a more efficient and a more productive way, and since you understand and believe that our intentions are to give you as much information as you require to perform the review, we can carry on as long as it is necessary. and i think you understand very well that there is no stone walling from the part of the greek government. so, in that respect, i think we have reached a modus mivendi in providing that information and we will continue to do so. so, the more we cooperate, the better the flow of information will be. now, on the other hand, in uh, in the brussels group meeting in the last three days, we have presented a number of our proposed reforms and we have actually put numbers on those reforms. and we compared the baseline scenario with reforms we intend to take that will affect that and produce a viable solution for greece.",1900-01-01 00:29:02,2015-04-01 00:00:00
nikos theocarakis,"in fact, after the discussions we had, we produced a new document that has taken into consideration all those comments we had received, which we have sent a few hours ago to the members of the brussels group and i will be very happy to send a copy to all members of the euro working group. now, there are many issues i would like to address. for example, it was mentioned that there is a tendency, when a good measure has been adopted by the previous government, that to resist to adopt this measure simply because it has been adopted by the previous government. this is simply not true. to be frank, in many cases, when we entered minister’s offices, we find only the furniture. so, in some ways, we’re not even well informed about the work that has been done from our side. but, also, we know and i think you know, that our true intentions is to apply all those measures that would lead to the creation of a better, just, fair and more efficient state that is commensurate to the expectations of the greek peopl and our partners in the european union to which were invariably committed.",1900-01-01 00:30:38,2015-04-01 00:00:00
nikos theocarakis,"for example, there are other international organizations such as the ilo or the oecd we’re working in close cooperation with them, there are teams as we speak from our ministries that go through the oecd people to produce agreements. so, this is not an ideological thing we’re talking about. and in fact, ideology works both ways. what you see as common sense, we see as ideology and vice versa. so, the idea is to find out what is optimal for greece so that we have a viable, developing and growing economy that will make sustainable the payment of its debt. and i’m happy to know that… you know that we have reached agreements in many issues and that we are in the process of working even further",1900-01-01 00:32:02,2015-04-01 00:00:00
nikos theocarakis,"with you to resolve matters that are subject of negotiations and that in some we can yield, and you know also that because we have specific commitments to the greek people, there are other issues which we have costed and we shall not go back. take pension reform for example. you call it a rollback. on the other hand, in the view of my government, reducing pension sharply for those on low pensions is not really a reform.",1900-01-01 00:33:03,2015-04-01 00:00:00
nikos theocarakis,"we are in the process of reforming the pension system. this will take time, it will take actual studies, and all that. but we have costed that there’s a little more than one billion, not to accept the zero deficit clause in our pensions system. this will be done only for this year, and then we will, with your technical assistance, come up with a system that is both fair and viable.",1900-01-01 00:33:34,2015-04-01 00:00:00
nikos theocarakis,"regarding the issue of early retirement, i think we said that in the brussels group, that our government is committed to pass a law that restricts early retirement in most cases, excepting those for example who are suddenly disability appears and the like.",1900-01-01 00:34:03,2015-04-01 00:00:00
nikos theocarakis,"privatisation, another issue that has been raised. i think it is p- peculiar, to say the least, that a left-wing government is more sincere about privatisation than a right-wing government. and there was a lot of talks about how much we are going to get from privatisations, but we are budgeting 1.5 billion, and we’re in the process of continuing the process.",1900-01-01 00:34:23,2015-04-01 00:00:00
nikos theocarakis,"but in this process, we will improve vastly upon it, especially in the realm of offering safe and property rights to bidders. and minimizing the likelihood of legal challenges of the  led to the undoing of previous privatisations. in this sense, there’s nothing worse in privatisations about, uh, for the, uh, potential investor not to know that his bid is secure.",1900-01-01 00:34:49,2015-04-01 00:00:00
nikos theocarakis,"so we would like to ask in the future, minimum investment provisions, state equity for the government, local economy development, and, uh, some minimum conditions for our employees, and we would like to escape the firesale logic. on the other hand, we tend to enhance the property right of the bidders by offering them things about the development of their properties, that were not there and in fact were gridlocked in, uh, those privatisations.",1900-01-01 00:35:17,2015-04-01 00:00:00
nikos theocarakis,"so we are very clear about the privatisations we are going to do. we are going to respect everything that has been legally done by the previous government, and in fact increased the property rights of those who have entered in privatisation agreement for the greek government.",1900-01-01 00:35:50,2015-04-01 00:00:00
nikos theocarakis,"now regarding for example, issues like the moratorium of foreclosures. first, it has not been tabled in parliament yet, and also we believe that what can be seen as optimal at the micro level, what could be disastrous at the macro level, it is the fallacy of composition so to speak. foreclosures of primary residents at the time when house prices are extremely depressed is in reality undermining the capitalization of the banks, seeing as they further reduce the value of the real estate portfolio.",1900-01-01 00:36:10,2015-04-01 00:00:00
nikos theocarakis,"i think people from the brussels group heard the, uh, secretary general of public revenue, katerina savvaidou, discussing what a disaster was the attempt to go through auctions of people who actually had large properties. the, the, the problem was that there is no liquidity, there is no prospect, there are property taxes. no one wants to own property, so unless we accept a level of real estate of the past of real estate in greece, that is absolutely out of the money, the, the whole thing would be disastrous in our case.",1900-01-01 00:36:41,2015-04-01 00:00:00
nikos theocarakis,"so, uh, regarding collective bargaining, we of course willing to work with the ilo in establishing best practices and not going back to a system that was definitely not optimal. on the other hand, what do we see is that as a result of the agreements of the previous government, it has been a total dismantling of collective bargaining in greece to a level that i don’t think that other european countries who have a history of, uh, worker’s right culture, so to speak, was there.",1900-01-01 00:37:21,2015-04-01 00:00:00
nikos theocarakis,"so, and take another example. in labor market reforms, i think we know our little market better than other people, and one of the basic characteristics of our labor market is that one third of those employed, and let alone the one quarter of those… of the labor force who are unemployed, are undeclared, uninsured labor. so we said quite specifically, what we really need in terms of labor market reform is to make more important and more intense the inspection by the labor inspectorate so what that there is a crackdown on undeclared and uninsured labor.",1900-01-01 00:37:57,2015-04-01 00:00:00
nikos theocarakis,"this would have very sizeable effects on our pension funds and i think we really underestimated that effect, uh, but say 150, uh, million euros. it will-",1900-01-01 00:38:38,2015-04-01 00:00:00

nikos theocarakis,"okay.  uh, we have today submitted to the brussels group this detailed 26-page document that explains the reform that our government is proposing. so you will see there, when you read it, that we have incorporated feedback from the institutions during the discussion. so, uh, i will send it forthwith when we finish this review.",1900-01-01 00:39:33,2015-04-01 00:00:00
nikos theocarakis,"but let me read and i think that we are in a very good, uh, direction with the institutions. now, there is a problem however, that we should not let the review become a post-mortem. we are running out on the 9th. we shall not legislate in order to soak up from various organization the last drops of liquidity left. so in fact, there is no way that we can go beyond the 9th of april.",1900-01-01 00:39:58,2015-04-01 00:00:00
nikos theocarakis,"we are very keen to continue with the brussels groups and the technical team discussions in athens. we are eager to introduce to parliament a number of reform bills very quickly pushing forward mutually agreed reforms. and to be frank, the very idea that the full final review will preceed an arrangement that looks after liquidity in the very short run is in our government’s view, quite unrealistic.",1900-01-01 00:40:32,2015-04-01 00:00:00
thomas wieser,"so uh, we’ve now had, uh, uh, very, very, uh, uh, differentiated views over the process, uh, is, uh, quite frankly from nikos, i haven’t… the only thing i gathered on process that’s, uh, you remain willing both in athens and in brussels, which i think is, uh, is very fine. um, before i open up to colleagues to ask a question and comments , um, i would simply say, uh, what my understanding is in terms of the process.",1900-01-01 00:41:10,2015-04-01 00:00:00
thomas wieser,"uh, what, uh, we as the euro working group, uh, need to do, uh, is, uh, wait until the three institutions and the greek authorities have reached a complete, uh, agreement, uh, on a comprehensive views, uh, which is, uh, analyzed, uh, costed, uh, and, uh, which shows, uh, what the economic and fiscal policy consequences are.",1900-01-01 00:41:49,2015-04-01 00:00:00

thomas wieser,"um, as an intermediate steps, i would like to pick up on, uh, that and also as an intermediate step permits to generate, uh, a credible perspective of a successful conclusion of the meeting. and a credible perspective of a successful conclusion of the review is in my view, and not only my view, uh, a complete list of measures, uh, which i think touches upon those which the greek government, uh, is wishing to implement but which also needs to deal, uh, in a succinct manner, uh, with the other 30% percent ",1900-01-01 00:42:57,2015-04-01 00:00:00
thomas wieser,"so, uh, i guess, uh, we are, from what i have heard, still quite a long way, even from this intermediate, uh, step, and i would, and, uh, uh, i would ask ask some questions a) on content and b) on procedure before we proceed. so who wants to take it here?",1900-01-01 00:44:03,2015-04-01 00:00:00

thomas steffen,"second point on substance, would be very helpful to get some more information from the three institutions and maybe marco could, uh, help us on the latest proposals coming from athens. i guess, uh, this is part of the latest proposals, uh, that, uh, greece again is proposing some debt relief, uh, which i fail to understand because, uh, greece has subscribed to commit…uh, to honor its commitments. i don’t know whether this is true, but again, marco maybe can help us.",1900-01-01 00:46:36,2015-04-01 00:00:00
thomas steffen,"second, on the proposed fiscal measures, as well as on the lower primary surplus, uh, i’m wondering if those, uh, measures, how the three institutions at the end of the day can confirm their sustainability. i simply, uh, don’t know, but to have some flavor, uh, again, would be quite helpful.",1900-01-01 00:47:10,2015-04-01 00:00:00
thomas steffen,"um, on process, thomas i’m totally agreeing with your… what you just said. we need a, uh, complete agreement on the comprehensive, uh, list. and, uh, just to add to that, uh, let’s be as precise as possible because we are all under, i would call it democratic control, what i would need for any disbursement, which by the way would be very much in line with our statement 20th_february. i first need the staff level agreement, um, as you said, comprehensive one. second i need a report of the state of play of the  including a debt sustainability analysis. i very much hope that the three institutions, uh, will be in a position to confirm that this is what they are working on.",1900-01-01 00:47:35,2015-04-01 00:00:00

marco buti,"um, i, uh, recall what you, thomas, indicated at the very beginning, namely that there is a agreement that what would, uh, uh, emerge up the list, the list, would be, uh, something which, uh, has, uh, uh, the full backing of the institutions and not just simply let’s say the, um, ideas or proposals by the greek authorities, precisely to, um, let’s say frame the n- the next thing in the process which would, uh… which may allow i think to, uh, uh, genuinely consider that the… by implementing those, uh, measures, um, the review would have a chance to be completed.",1900-01-01 00:55:39,2015-04-01 00:00:00
marco buti,"and with that, uh, possibility an idea, i took under the council of benoit, who can confirm or not, possibly, uh, unlock some decisions of the, uh, of the ecb, um, on, uh, the same matters which are under their, uh, um, responsibility, uh, which, uh, could, uh, if they come, uh… let’s say if, if they process insufficiently,  would leave them to, uh, alleviate some concern, uh, to the liquidity, uh, situation.",1900-01-01 00:56:53,2015-04-01 00:00:00
marco buti,"now, e- in the light of this, uh, while understanding, uh,  person material piece, l- i call it like that rather than, uh, than let’s say a list, um, uh, considering the, th- th- th- the usual institutional concerns that thomas stetton, uh, indicated, um, and, uh, let’s say in spite of the generosity of, uh, nikos theocarakis in terms of, uh, uh, putting this available for this… for the, you know, benefit of the knowledge of the colleagues, i would be a little bit weary on, um, uh, let’s say having a full distribution of this program and it may, uh, crystallize, um, let’s say the, um, the intentions around something which has not, uh, uh, yet the pa- the backing of the-",1900-01-01 00:57:29,2015-04-01 00:00:00

marco buti,"and, uh, on, uh, i think on the question thomas  on the, uh, on the debt relief, uh, i mean maybe nikos should be the one, uh, who, uh, replies. we stick to the agreement that today is fully supported by all the parties, uh, uh, all the countries in the eurogroup. namely that, that fully repayment, uh, off all the creditors, uh, will, uh, take place and there is a greek commitment on, uh, on, uh, on that.",1900-01-01 01:00:41,2015-04-01 00:00:00

speaker 5,"so what we are discussing here is a, a, a start that can, uh, bring, uh, greece back to market access. and anything that the ecb can do on or not do,uh, will just be a consequence of this process. so it is not .",1900-01-01 01:04:04,2015-04-01 00:00:00
speaker 5,"now coming to the, to the consequence that the governing council could draw, um, there are two separate issues. uh, the first issue relates to the waiver the, and, uh, as, uh, as i said, uh, the, uh, waiver is about, uh, having the programs  and so that’s about having a credible perspective of, uh, a conclusion of the lev- of a success- successful conclusion of the review. and that’s what we need to see to the reinstate the waiver.",1900-01-01 01:04:26,2015-04-01 00:00:00

speaker 5,"so, uh, you can have one or the other or both or neither of the two, it depends on, on the, on the first one… on the one hand for the prospect for successful conclusion of the review. on the second hand, the prospect uh, of, uh, a  regaining market effort, and that’s two different discussions. so, uh, uh, a- and, uh, the extent of the discussion we’re having today is that it’s anyway too early, uh, to put that discussion to the governing council. so i’m not even going to ask the governing council today, given the discussion we’re having, uh, uh right now.",1900-01-01 01:05:25,2015-04-01 00:00:00

speaker 6,"…situation. um, as we’ve seen over the last recent days, um, there are ways, uh, to, uh, manage, uh, the available cash, uh, existing in the general government, um, in the broad sense. there is cash in extra-budgetary entities outside of the central government. there is cash in regional authorities. there are ways to generate cash, um, that are, and we, we’re not suggesting that the greek government should  that certainly would not be our recommendation. and we are not in a position to say that. uh, but there are ways to generate cash, such as selling shares in public companies, uh, so there are different ways to generate cash and our advice to the government is really to look, uh, at all possible ways, uh, possibly using the legislative instrument, as marco, like in the netherlands, which can be replicated quite easily.",1900-01-01 01:06:03,2015-04-01 00:00:00

luca antonio ricci,"thank you, thomas, uh, let me just come to a couple of points that were, that were very raised. so, first on the fiscal measures that we have seen. it’s very clear that the fiscal measures that have been put on the table are moving away from parametric measures, measures that are very easy to implement and easy to collect, to minuscule measures that have a very weak history of collections in greece.",1900-01-01 01:07:05,2015-04-01 00:00:00
luca antonio ricci,"as such, the, the use that the authorities are considering are far too optimistic. clearly a lot more technical discussions need to go into this but where it currently stands, ’cause we feel the measures that have been put on the table which was just way, way too optimistic. now, in terms of the way the system measures  surplus target that was set for last year.",1900-01-01 01:07:32,2015-04-01 00:00:00
luca antonio ricci," is 1.5% of gdp, the authorities are, are projecting that they will fall very far short of that. the technical discussions are continuing and we think that there could actually be a deficit that would be registered last year and this is entirely because of non-implementation of measures and backtracking of measures in the later part of last year by the previous government.",1900-01-01 01:08:12,2015-04-01 00:00:00

nikos theocarakis,"okay. so, let me redirect again that we’re soon running out of money and it’s very hard to go beyond the ninth of april. now, uh, marco, both marco and benoit mentioned the extra cash that is, there available, and that uh, requires legislation, but in our parliament we haven’t passed such legislation, since it would not suffice both for imf repayments and paying for wages and pensions. so it would not make a difference. now, recall that our stressed state already made payments of almost seven billion this year without having benefited from scheduled disbursements.",1900-01-01 01:09:46,2015-04-01 00:00:00
nikos theocarakis,"so we paid seven billion but received none. now, regarding the measures list. now the brussels group has received a comprehensive list in excel form of our reform proposals that demonstrate the 70, 30 mix that these, which measures from the tenth of december list from the institution we accept and which we propose to change and how. today, we improved on that list after the discussions we had in the brussels group and we have sent this detailed document outlining our proposal for each one of these measures, both the 70% and the 30% parts.",1900-01-01 01:10:33,2015-04-01 00:00:00

thomas wieser,"so, um, there is one strand of possibility that we have this agreement reaching us by, uh, next wednesday. that requires a huge amount of work and a fabulous, uh, speeding up of technical experts work in athens. uh, if that is not the case, i think our next round to do, uh, after next wednesday, uh, would be 10 days or 12 days  of the week where riga takes place.",1900-01-01 01:29:58,2015-04-01 00:00:00
thomas wieser,"i think a number of suggestions have been made, uh, on the liquidity issue, i don’t think that this is the place or the time to go into that or any detail. let me just finish by reminding our greek colleagues, uh, that there are rules in place which govern, uh, the selection of personal through the hfsf which is required, which are required, which have been put into place by mutual consent, as part of the overall arrangement in order to ensure that the hfsf is indeed, uh, an institution which is run at arms length from any government. so this is not a political issue. this is a generic governance issue, uh, the selection procedures which involve the euro working group have been respected in the past and if they were not respected this time around, and there are rules ",1900-01-01 01:30:35,2015-04-01 00:00:00
thomas wieser,"so, uh, that would be, yeah. that would be more or less how i see, uh, the process and, uh, the procedure. if there is anybody with violent, uh, disagreement with this, this is now the time, uh, to say so, uh, other than that we would be seeing each other next wednesday, uh, and if something, uh, uh, spectacular, dramatic, of very good news, happens in the meantime, i would expect that the institutions would inform us and i could inform you in turn.",1900-01-01 01:31:51,2015-04-01 00:00:00

nikos theocarakis,"yes, uh, nikos theocarakis, so, uh, to make a few points. the first is regarding the hfsf, let me state that the greek government operates perfectly within the, the bounds of legality. the second point i would like to make is about, uh, the comment that, um, it was a first that people from the imf another institutions were not well prepared.",1900-01-01 01:33:50,2015-04-01 00:00:00

thomas wieser,"so, uh, if people are in agreement then i would respond just, uh, with two or three very laconic, technical sentences. i will say that the only purpose of this conference call, uh, was to be updated by the three institutions and the greek colleagues on, uh, where, uh, the talks in athens and in brussels, uh, are, uh, are at.",1900-01-01 01:38:06,2015-04-01 00:00:00

thomas wieser,"yeah, it’s a mutual problem. it’s not only your problem, it’s a mutual problem. but, uh, i think this uh, is a special case, because for some reason, i would not care to speculate who has been hyping this conference call as sort of unlocking liquidity from the ecb, and, uh, god knows what, uh, which for anybody who knows the process, uh, was, uh, quite the crazy thing. but so this has been bandied about by people who don’t know anything about the process, uh, which doesn’t help us very much. so, uh, if, uh, for the future, we can keep expectations, uh, low to the ground, uh, in our domest-, amongst our domestic audiences, uh, keep to the confidentiality, uh, which is, uh, uh, required also by our statutes. maybe we have a short discussion of these issues, uh, of how we work, uh, um, what the confidentiality issues are, and how things are spread back home, et cetera, et cetera. maybe we’ll have a short talk on these issues, uh, when we meet next week again.",1900-01-01 01:41:09,2015-04-01 00:00:00

jeroen dijsselbloem,"so implementation can once again start. i would like to use this, um, uh, discussion now to be updated. first of all by the institutions, where we are, what progress has been made and what th-the key issues are, so we are informed and understand the state of play and of course i will also ask yanis his perspective on the situation and his expectations for the coming weeks. um, i think i will do it in one round, uh, and ask pierre to inform us first unless yanis wants to take the floor first, it’s up to you.",1900-01-01 00:02:38,2015-04-24 00:00:00
pierre moscovici,"thank you jeroen. um, let me um, begin by saying that we uh, welcome the greek authorities’ intention to cooperate with the euro area and imf and to work with the institutions. following february’s agreement which is uh, our roadmap greek authorities shared drafts set by these initiatives uh, further material provided in the course of march and april uh, has represented useful contributions uh, that in talks, in brussels, in athens, in paris uh, they have been held in goodwill, uh, with discussions more open and focused and covered a wide range of issues.",1900-01-01 00:03:20,2015-04-24 00:00:00
pierre moscovici,"uh, however, we must acknowledge that today, that only very small steps uh, have been made in terms of narrowing the policy gap. overall, uh, current policy intentions do not yet represent what we expect, which is a critical package, measures that could deliver sustainable public finances, some financial system and a competitive economy. uh, and discussions are moving, but in our view, they are moving slowly and let’s tell it as we believe it, far too slowly. uh, unless change here seems difficult to achieve in the next week, a comprehensive package that offers a credible prospect of being able to complete the review. we need clarity, specifically to have confidence in the robustness and credibility of actions in the areas which have been indicated and others. um, we have seen, uh, limited ambition uh, in key reform areas such as labor market, uh, pensions, or on the moratoria on auctions.",1900-01-01 00:04:06,2015-04-24 00:00:00
pierre moscovici,"we understand some of these may be particularly difficult, like the commitments made  the democratic electoral process, which we see as being fully recognized. and there is some room of flexible, but only if shortfalls in one domain are offset by ambitious delivery in others, which was the logic of the 20th_february agreement. uh, let me raise just a few detailed points on some areas where differences exist.",1900-01-01 00:05:20,2015-04-24 00:00:00
pierre moscovici,"on fiscal and macro, we need to come to- common understanding. realism in projections is needed, our starting point for discussion, cannot be one of no fiscal effort is needed in 2015, sufficient effort should be undertaken as needed over the medium run. we can consider a lower target for 2015 but there is still a gap to be closed and as , so should ambition.",1900-01-01 00:05:52,2015-04-24 00:00:00
pierre moscovici,"second, on labor market reforms. the gap is still large in consultation with social partners  on privatization, our long-standing ambitious plan is now de facto stopped. although the government has indicated it intends to continue with some projects this year.",1900-01-01 00:06:24,2015-04-24 00:00:00
pierre moscovici,"we need to have further details, which have not yet been provided and to propose change on the remaining uh, assets. tentatively, based on this cursory information received, we believe that the plan needs more ambition and that the risk is that it falls significantly short of what is expected financially from privatization. this also i think will be a very important signal to investors. uh, on financial stability there are growing concerns about banks’ balance sheets.",1900-01-01 00:07:13,2015-04-24 00:00:00
pierre moscovici,"uh, let me stress once again that policy initiatives need to be concrete, they need to be time bound and mutually consistent. previously agreed measures need to be respected, uh, the institutions are willing to consider what could be substituted with equitable measures in line with government priorities. once again this is about the flexibility which has been recognized in the agreement of 20th_february. but some changes must be carefully calibrated and discussed openly. we also talked about  action. rollback of measures and unilateral changes to policies and structural reforms are not expedient means of eventual progress.",1900-01-01 00:07:51,2015-04-24 00:00:00
pierre moscovici,"policy initiative should be discussed ex ante, this principle must be respected mutually and the basis of work going forward. in this respect let me stress uh, our willingness to work and tackle authorities’ genuine concern on protecting the most vulnerable. but this needs to be done using targeted instrument directed at those who are most in need . we welcome, the recent decision to centralize cash dispersed to all entities of general government. while this may provide some breathing space for the next few days, this solution we all know, cannot last.",1900-01-01 00:08:35,2015-04-24 00:00:00
pierre moscovici,"so to conclude, i would say that time, as we all know, is of the essence. that time is now extremely limited. delays come with the risk, even liquidity change,  together.",1900-01-01 00:09:31,2015-04-24 00:00:00
jeroen dijsselbloem,thank you. mario?,1900-01-01 00:10:37,2015-04-24 00:00:00
mario draghi,"let me, first give you an update on the bank liquidity and . renewed uncertainty about the discussions with the institutions on the conclusion of the review and on the ability to meet future debt obligations. greek sovereign bond yields have reached the highest levels during this week since the debt restructuring in 2012. but there have been no significant contagion effects to other countries. at the same time the liquidity conditions of banks remain strained and fragile.",1900-01-01 00:10:43,2015-04-24 00:00:00
mario draghi,"we have seen accelerated deposit outflows since we last met, last time, on the back of increased uncertainty related to the discussions around the imf spring meetings. the adoption of the law on deposit transfers from the general government funds to the bank of greece and to a lesser extent the resolution of the small cooperative bank panellinia. due to the loss of deposits and other sources of financing the greek banking system currently receives 111 billion euros of central bank liquidity, more than doubling last december’s reliance and the highest level as a share of gdp of any euro area country.",1900-01-01 00:11:21,2015-04-24 00:00:00
mario draghi,"on april 22, 2015, the governing council non objected to an increase the ela ceiling of euro 75.5 billion until and including 29th of april 2015 representing an increase of another 1.5 billion euro for the previous week. the ecb will continue extending liquidity to the greek banks while there are solvent and they have sufficient collateral. however, we should be aware that the collateral of greek banks is limited and that its value is decreasing when greek government bond yields rise. moreover, in light of recent developments in the increased risk of default of the hellenic republic, the governing council may need to assess the quality of the collateral used for ela purposes including the applicable haircuts.",1900-01-01 00:12:07,2015-04-24 00:00:00
mario draghi,"so, the extreme fragile market and liquidity situation underlies the urgency of making progress in restoring confidence in the greek economy. it’s absolutely essential that now decisive steps are taken to have agreement with the institutions and restore calm into the financial system. on the program itself, i entirely agree with the remarks made by pierre moscovici. on the- especially on the fiscal part of the program uh, it’s quite- it’s essential that agreement be reached on the macroeconomic projections, on the growth projections, so that a reasonable figure for the fiscal surplus can be agreed upon.",1900-01-01 00:13:11,2015-04-24 00:00:00
mario draghi,"and the second point where agreement is absolutely needed and its very, very urgent, is the series of structural reforms. let me list some of them, because one of them is the independence of the hfsf, is of crucial importance for us. the reforms in product and services markets, again here much more determination is needed. the pension reforms, it’s kind of pointless to have pension laws that are fiscally unsustainable.",1900-01-01 00:13:55,2015-04-24 00:00:00
mario draghi,"the labor market reforms and uh, in general, in general the refraining from unilateral actions. so the outcome of this agreement should be a strong policy package that would produce growth while having a certain level of equity, respect in fiscal sustainability and financial stability. thank you.",1900-01-01 00:14:25,2015-04-24 00:00:00

poul mathias thomsen,"thank you jeroen. so, i agree with the remarks uh, made by pierre and mario. i agree that the discussions have been  good will and more open. i also want to be… make clear that we… there are… very vast differences we’re making in all key areas. i think there’s much progress in narrowing the differences that we take some of the major areas, one by one. fiscal. on the fiscal, uh, we are in the situation where we don’t have final numbers for 2014, but it’s clear that rather than reaching the target of 1.5, we are probably at best, at balance. because of backtracking of measures by the previous government, in the second half of last year.",1900-01-01 00:14:54,2015-04-24 00:00:00
poul mathias thomsen,"we might even have had a small deficit last year. now, we have not, the new government has not presented us a revised budget for 2015. we have not been able to have that discussion, but it has said that it wants to backtrack in a number of areas. for instance, on pension reforms, the backtracking amounts, to…uh, if i include uh, the budget to pay a thirteenth pension, to almost 1% of gdp.",1900-01-01 00:15:49,2015-04-24 00:00:00
poul mathias thomsen,"what, what…on pensions, backtracking, yes. backtracking on almost 1% of gdp, almost. uh, altogether, i think that if we, uh, if we just take the proposals that have been put on the table, without the benefit of having seen a comprehensive budget proposal by the government, we think that you will have a deficit of 1-1.5% of gdp, this year, this year. compared to a target of plus three, without measures. so we are facing a huge gap, a huge gap, between where we are going to come out without measures, um, and where we wanted to be, and we certainly agree that the 3% is not attainable anymore, that’s for sure.",1900-01-01 00:16:21,2015-04-24 00:00:00
poul mathias thomsen,"uh, as the two others previous speakers said, there are major backtracking on on on pension reforms, on the fiscal structural reforms that are needed to get us to where we wanted to go over the next couple of years. pension reforms, tax administration is moving in the wrong direction, and public administration reforms are moving, all three of them are moving in the wrong direction.",1900-01-01 00:17:09,2015-04-24 00:00:00
poul mathias thomsen,"uh, so, so we, you know, we need to have that discussion, uh before we can even, uh discuss what is feasible and reasonable targets over the medium term. as others have said, labor market reforms are proposed to be reversed, although the government has not done so, yet. product market reforms, there are some reversals there already, uh, but there is also a reluctance to go ahead with the framework that we had agreed, uh, for opening up of closed profession. mario can comment on the financial sector.",1900-01-01 00:17:44,2015-04-24 00:00:00
poul mathias thomsen,"so throughout these important areas, there are major differences, and i think it’s important, i have to caution you what that would mean from our perspective, is that six months ago, we thought that greece could go back to, possibly could go back to the market. and there would be no need for new money. with uh, with these, with these programs, with these proposals we have now, there will be a need for very, very significant new money.",1900-01-01 00:18:21,2015-04-24 00:00:00
poul mathias thomsen,"secondly, until six months ago, we thought that there would be no need for debt relief. under the november 2011 framework, agreed with the eurogroup, we thought that these targets could… were basically achievable given where we were six months ago. if we aren’t uh… if we start deviating, in any notable way, from the existing program, be it primary target, be it privatization, be it the reforms underlying what already is very, very ambitious goals for some things.",1900-01-01 00:18:58,2015-04-24 00:00:00
poul mathias thomsen,"if that’s the case, we will be looking at the need for very significant debt relief, from europe also, in order to ensure that this package is, package is sustainable. so, i think, you know, we need to keep this in mind, as we go forward. i do not want you to come back later and say that, that we sort of, jumped a surprise on you, in this regard. what should be done moving forward? uh, i do think that the process needs to… still needs to improve. we’re still in a situation where our mission chiefs are not allowed to correlate the work in athens. we’re still in a mission chiefs where our people sit in a hotel room and, , in athens and not, can’t go to the ministries. it is not efficient. we .. err know, when we did this discussion in the previous four or five years, we always had the mission chiefs and discussions with ministers and their senior staff. uh, policy level discussion with ministers and their senior staff. then, it was another round of technical meeting and then more meetings with ministers. we had not one single time through the process with  where we had discussions with ministers. it’s not happened.",1900-01-01 00:19:36,2015-04-24 00:00:00
poul mathias thomsen,"so, uh, there is… it’s, the process needs to improve, uh, so that we can get into negotiations. we are not negotiating, at this stage. i, uh, and i think that is the diff–, also, for the, for the government to be able to move from what is still policies and objective, that are very, very broadly uh, defined and there are not anywhere close to specific action plans. uh, so i, i think we need to…we need to discuss process also here, how to take it forward. thank you.",1900-01-01 00:20:57,2015-04-24 00:00:00

klaus regling,"thank you. thank you. just two small points to add because there are not mentioned before. one is on the financial sector reform. the proposals that i see are more geared to protect um, indebted households and corporates. they are not here to strengthen the budget of banks and i think that could be a problem for us, given that hfsf money, 37 billion euro was given in the context of the program to strengthen the banking sector. so this could become a problem i think for all of us.",1900-01-01 00:21:37,2015-04-24 00:00:00
klaus regling,"the second point is, just as a reminder um, smp downgraded um, greece last week to triple-c and that means that now all the major rating agencies are on this triple-c territory which indicates a real probability of default. the readings are rating reports which are publicly available. it is clear that the rating agencies are following very closely the progress of the negotiations um, the liquidity situation and so on.",1900-01-01 00:22:15,2015-04-24 00:00:00
klaus regling,"um, and the rating action, we need to remember will also have an impact on the liquidity of banks. um, and the cost of funds for banks but also for corporates and  the borrowers, so it will be detrimental for the real economy. thank you.",1900-01-01 00:22:47,2015-04-24 00:00:00

thomas wieser,"therefore, on timing um, everybody is quite  results need to be produced very very soon. the next eurogroup is on the 11 may, which essentially is two working weeks away from today. if we work backwards uh, that could imply that agreement between the greek authorities, if one were to take that as a target which is not certain. but if one works backwards uh, the processes that we need in the euro-working group to prepare the eurogroup etc. that would mean that agreement needs to be found within a week.",1900-01-01 00:24:25,2015-04-24 00:00:00
thomas wieser,"agreement means very specified documentation of course. so uh, the conclusion that i would draw is that something has to change possibly, in terms of the process because this is what ministers uh, expect uh, and their parliaments expect, is a very detailed, written technical document and not in a political narrative. so that is uh, the conclusion that i would draw from that talk uh, and where the separate items such as fiscal  institutions.",1900-01-01 00:25:13,2015-04-24 00:00:00

yanis varoufakis,"let me, just briefly, um, mention some areas of agreement and disagreement. just to give colleagues flair of the kind of progress that we have made, both us and the institutions. let me begin with the example of tax administration. it was, um, um, part of the previous government’s, uh, commitment to the institutions that, uh, the tax authority, the general secretariat of public revenues within my ministry, should be given greater autonomy.",1900-01-01 00:27:04,2015-04-24 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"and i believe there was worry amongst colleagues, as well as the institutions that our government would want to claw some of this back, to roll it back. well, i’m pleased to report that not only are we not doing this, but we now have consensus in the government to actually take it further than what the institutions ever asked for.",1900-01-01 00:27:46,2015-04-24 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"we are, um, interested in and committed to now creating a fully independent tax authority. independent both of political intervention, interference, but also corporate interference. and we’re keen to work with the institutions in order to create the- this kind of irs-like, uh, separate entity that looks after public revenues.",1900-01-01 00:28:02,2015-04-24 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"and as the minister of finance, i have to tell you, on a personal basis, that i’m very much looking forward not to have such control over public revenues. also, uh, regarding the independence of authorities such as the hellenic statistical authority elstat, and the hfsf that mario, uh, mentioned, i believe it was mario and maybe klaus, if memory serves. uh, let me reiterate our government’s commitment to strengthen the independence of such, uh, bodies, uh, in full compliance with what the institutions and colleagues here around the table, uh, consider to be appropriate. on other issues, i- i just- i will not- i do not propose to go through, uh, very many of them, because this is something for us and the institutions to work out in the brussels group and so on and so forth. but just- i ju- i just want to give you a flavor of the progress as we see it and the reason why we think that we are, uh, on the right path. maybe we should be moving forward faster, but we are nevertheless on the right path.",1900-01-01 00:28:26,2015-04-24 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"uh, take the issue of vat. there is a disagreement of sorts between us and the institutions regarding the emphasis. our emphasis goes on collection. let me give you a brief example. last year on the famous islands of mykonos and santorini, we had tourism, economic activity, tourist activity doubled, and yet disgracefully, absolutely disgracefully, vat collection went down by 30%. this has nothing to do with the rate of vat. that has to do with the failure of our tax authorities to collect it. so we put more emphasis on- on collection- on the collectability. the institutions put more emphasis on harmonization and looking at different rates, but i have no doubt that in good faith we can work this out, we can hammer out an agreement on this, uh, which i will not now bother you with as to how exactly it will be- it will manifest itself.",1900-01-01 00:29:34,2015-04-24 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"on the question of privatizations, i heard pierre, uh, mention that and- and- and- and paul mention that there’s been backtracking. i don’t believe that backtracking or rolling back is apt as a description of what we’re doing. after a few weeks of deliberating as a new government, we have now come to a very clear position on this. we are continuing with the privatization drive, only we are resetting the parameters in a way that i think that colleagues, if i was given an opportunity to explain, my se – my hunch is colleagues would agree with what we’re saying. what we’re saying is that privatizations must happen in a way that, um, removes them from the realm of fire sales, which is what we’ve had in the past few years. so, it is not that we are slowing down privatizations, it is that we want to put greater emphasis not on the sale price, but on things like minimum investment provisions by the bidders.",1900-01-01 00:30:30,2015-04-24 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"we want the state to retain an equity, like it happens in many other european countries around this table. we want to have-uh, in case of regional airports, let’s say for example, we would like greater commitment and planning for an integration of, uh, the new activities in these privatized facilities, with the local economies. so, our purpose is to remove the emphasis or to shift the emphasis away from the, uh, just, you know, the- the asking price or the bidding price and placing it- shifting it towards greater developmental, uh, um, impact and the multiplied accelerated- accelerated effects that these will have.",1900-01-01 00:31:45,2015-04-24 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"shifting on very quickly to the question of labor markets. now, this is where we may agree to disagree with paul and maybe some others. we believe that, uh, a labor market like greece’s is not just excessively deregulated as it is, in practice, not so much in law but in practice. but it is a labor market that should all make us particularly worried regarding the degree of informality.",1900-01-01 00:32:27,2015-04-24 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"when you have a labor market, which has shrunk significantly due to the recession and on top of that, more than 30% of paid labor is informal undeclared labor, one realizes that standard arguments about deregulation fail to connect with the reality on the ground. so, when we talk about, for instance, a role for collective bargaining, that is not simply a return to what we had before, this is not what we plan to do, but a kind of smart collective bargaining framework, um, not different to the one we have in germany or in other european countries, uh, hammered out and designed together in association with the international labor organization for instance, uh, would help bring about a large number of workers into the formal sector again and therefore strengthen the pension system and strengthen our tax state.",1900-01-01 00:33:01,2015-04-24 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"uh, non-performing loans is a major issue. it keeps the credit circuits from functioning properly. it keeps our export-oriented companies from being able to fulfill orders and to finalize their transactions with, uh, their customers abroad as a result of the failure to secure letters of credit from the banking sector. these are all issues that we’re discussing with the institutions. these are all issues that we want to settle. and which i think we’re making considerable progress in finding common ground with the institutions. but be- uh, let me finish with a couple of, uh, points.",1900-01-01 00:33:55,2015-04-24 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"all this, as pierre very succinctly said, has to be, and i’m sure that mario and paul too would agree with, has to be embedded in a dynamically consistent fiscal plan, a dynamically consistent debt sustainability analysis. we are undogmatic about this. we don’t have any fixation about what the primary surplus should be. what we’re concerned about is the method, the method that has been, uh, utilized so far of saying, okay, in 2020, we want a particular debt to gdp ratio, let’s say 120% and now let’s work backwards, and their assumptions about, regarding the growth rate of, let’s say, 3% on average, what the primary surplus must be in 2019, ’18, ’17, all the way to today. and then we end up with a primary surplus, which in our estimation is not consistent with a growth rate, which is implicit, the assumption, for working out this kind of path.",1900-01-01 00:34:32,2015-04-24 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"so this is a kind of consolidation trap that we want to avoid. and we want to discuss it with the institutions, the dsa, that actually makes dynamically consistent sense. and this is an area of disagreement so far, but this government is absolutely committed to signing on the dotted line of a fiscal plan that makes sense, to us, and which we can fully commit to. unlike previous governments, you -you will allow me to say, we are not prepared, prepared to make pledges just in order to unl- unlock liquidity that we do not believe are possible to attain.",1900-01-01 00:35:42,2015-04-24 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"and i hope that the- our partners, the institutions, everyone around this table takes this in good faith and recognizes that this is a government that wants to make pledges that it can fulfill. finally, on the question of liquidity, i’m very much afraid that we are talking about very few days- week, less than two weeks before we have a serious, uh, chance of an accident. and it is our considered opinion that it will be a shame that these negotiations, which in our estimation, are proceeding along the lines that all of us want and which may very easily, uh, in the next few days or weeks, attain an agreement that is mutually beneficial to everyone, uh, be derailed by a liquidity, uh, sourced failure.",1900-01-01 00:36:20,2015-04-24 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"uh, we believe that sufficient progress has been made. and we are determined to put on, uh, to demonstrate constantly our utter commitment to making this negotiation bear fruit, so as to enable the eurogroup very shortly, even possibly through a teleconference, to make the statement which is necessary in order to create conditions for, uh, relaxing the liquidity constraint.",1900-01-01 00:37:16,2015-04-24 00:00:00

peter kažimír,"uh, we have agreed in february to have a comprehensive list of reforms by end of april. we don’t have it. instead, we saw reluctance to corporate, backtracking on some measures adopted before elections and fiscal sustainability is volatile. uh, personally though last month i refused to the union of pensioners in my country. i refused a proposal of a 13th pension introduction in my country. why? because medium term objective, fiscal responsibility, fiscal consolidation in my country. you can pay out additional pension to your pensioners if you have money enough.",1900-01-01 00:39:36,2015-04-24 00:00:00

jeroen dijsselbloem,"our colleagues, let me try and draw a conclusion possibly that is going back to what we agreed on the 20th and 24th of february where we were quite clear that the program could be, would allow for some flexibility if it would remain within the key targets of the program. in other words the program had to stay on track. we are now very close to the end of april and my understanding from the institutions even though yanis is a little more optimistic is that very very little progress has been made. um, i don’t think it’s useful to set new deadlines. i think we have to hold the energy in uh, to work on an agreement as soon as possible within, fully within the agreement we had, the statement of the 20th_february, having said that i think the way the process is going so far we cannot continue.",1900-01-01 00:42:33,2015-04-24 00:00:00

jeroen dijsselbloem,"on substance, i think we have uh, a reasonably clear picture of what the key issues are. um, i feel that uh, it’s going to be difficult to reach an agreement but i also feel that we have to. uh, and i think that hard work will have to be put in. i will not be optimistic about reaching an agreement before the next eurogroup so therefore, i will refrain from talking about new deadlines or aiming for an agreement before the next meeting, because as wieser said we would need an agreement, on a technical level within a week and where we are now i don’t think that is reasonable unless miracles happen. so uh, after the meeting i think it’s important that with the institutions and the greek government we talk about redesigning the process to get it at a higher level and a higher pace. um, that is ",1900-01-01 00:44:11,2015-04-24 00:00:00

luis de guindos,"i don’t know if you have prepared some messages because well, we are running out of time. we have a very short period of time and i think that we have to try to do our utmost. that in order, uh, to find a solution but i don’t know what message we can convey today after this meeting.",1900-01-01 00:55:38,2015-04-24 00:00:00

pier carlo padoan,"thanks jeroen. actually michel anticipated many of the things i wanted to say so very briefly let me just stress a few points. i just i have one point only and the point is let’s not fool ourselves. let’s not try to pretend that nothing is happening. here the framework which was agreed in february is simply collapsing. uh, the framework we had agreed in february was that greece needed to have a short term, few months, effort which was categorised under the extended program because this was needed for its own sake.",1900-01-01 01:03:11,2015-04-24 00:00:00

pier carlo padoan,"liquidity is running out in spite of the huge amount of liquidity that, as mario just reminded us, was given to the country. in proportions that are unprecedented in the euro zone. so that amount of liquidity tells a lot about the time that has been lost. so i am deeply frustrated by the fact that we are facing a situation which is very difficult to communicate by. let’s not fool ourselves without  this is not understood.",1900-01-01 01:04:16,2015-04-24 00:00:00
pier carlo padoan,"unless we dramatically change gear both in process and in content. it’s not about completing the reform program in two weeks. it’s about saying that this is a fresh start about issues that have to deal, first of all with the welfare of the greek people. but then also with the obvious fact, obvious to me at least, that you need at the same time build a structural reform program which boosts growth and enhances welfare and consistency with  figures in terms of fiscal and monetary.",1900-01-01 01:04:49,2015-04-24 00:00:00

speaker 19,just a short remark. i think it’s fairly clear that in terms of the process something fundamentally is wrong. uh and that we need to change that is obvious. now i think .,1900-01-01 01:05:45,2015-04-24 00:00:00

rimantas šadžius,"could i remind you that we started in february i think from discussing three trajectories of pierre’s moscovici and i was the one that – who said that, well the most likely trajectory is the third one, things go as they go, without any progress. until now we see this. uh, to find out the way uh, out of the situation, i think we also should recall the first message that was um, said by michel sapin, i also recall this in february. the first principle  that we should respect the will of greek people. i think today we have a full ground of changing this attitude.",1900-01-01 01:07:31,2015-04-24 00:00:00
rimantas šadžius,"i should tell you that lithuanian people that i’m representing didn’t vote for the present majority in the greek parliament. we even had no chance to say any argument during the election campaign so from this point of view uh, we have no obligation to support the measures that were proposed or given as promises uh, to the greek people. and i think uh, that we have a full right in lithuania to look critically at these proposals.",1900-01-01 01:08:31,2015-04-24 00:00:00
rimantas šadžius,"uh since paul has said that uh, well um, a huge financial assistance is looming some time in the future, i think uh, for negotiating this huge financial assistance, i also will have to explain the measures that have been taken, or have been planned or have been realised or not, uh in greece.",1900-01-01 01:09:08,2015-04-24 00:00:00
rimantas šadžius,"and here i recall first the example that was given by peter, the 13th pension that would amount to 1 percent of gdp, this assessment of imf, uh if i recall uh, correctly in lithuania we have overall 12 pensions of 8 percent of gdp. which means that the pension system of greece is unsustainable.",1900-01-01 01:09:31,2015-04-24 00:00:00
rimantas šadžius,"simply it is unsustainable. the second example, the second problem that was uh, widely discussed around this table was uh, the question of minimum wage. it was hidden somehow where i think they haven’t yet made the decisions uh, but still discussing it. to my mind and to mind of many people that i talk around in lithuania, it would be crazy to increase to that extent the minimum wage when you have uh, 30 percent of uh, unemployment plus 30 percent of gray employment in your country as was said by yanis.",1900-01-01 01:09:56,2015-04-24 00:00:00
rimantas šadžius,"um these two measures are the most evident things, the most evident points for discussion in the lithuanian society if uh, further assistance to greece from esm would be discussed. people don’t know what the structural balance is, what the private , quite recently and now everyone in lithuania compares how much we earn compared to other countries.",1900-01-01 01:10:41,2015-04-24 00:00:00
rimantas šadžius,"um, the situation that we do have in greece now tells me that this country lives not by its means. and what is happening now, i would not call this tragedy. uh, the lack of liquidity. i would call this natural economic adjustment. so this third trajectory uh, to-to it could be sustainable. this is also lithuanian experience. we have the same situation in 2009 where we lost one-third of taxation income quite immediately after the uh, financial crisis started.",1900-01-01 01:11:25,2015-04-24 00:00:00

rimantas šadžius,"we managed to construct a quite complicated legal mechanisms of compensating people in the future which is always the case, which is always the possibility. another possibility i think for those couple of thousands, which is many, civil servants that greek authorities consider, that were fired not justly. i think this could solve the problem in the future. but all these decisions, all these decisions should be taken by greek authorities. but here i think uh, the sovereignty of this country, it should be respected but we, the rest of the eurozone, we also have a say.",1900-01-01 01:12:29,2015-04-24 00:00:00
rimantas šadžius,"we also have a say because what is happening there affects our countries uh and there is no democratic counterbalance for that. because in a single separate country, if the government behaves not the way it should, uh, there is always people who can elect another government. we have no such possibility, but i think we have a possibility and we should use this possibility today to tell our greek friends that we care of- very much about.",1900-01-01 01:13:14,2015-04-24 00:00:00

yanis varoufakis,"i was struck by a certain disconnect between the atmosphere as i understand it in the negotiations, the brussels group in athens. between our authorities and the institutions and a certain degree of hostility which i encountered here today. hostility which i hope is going to simply dissipate and disappear very soon. i accept my lithuanian friend’s friendly pressure, i do believe that we need to be pressurized.",1900-01-01 01:17:20,2015-04-24 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"but i believe that all of us need to be pressurized into coming to a comple—a final conclusion to this saga. let me reassure all colleagues that this government is not going to contemplate even being dragged into the indignity of primary deficits again. we will do whatever it takes, we will introduce whatever measures it takes, in order to ensure that we do not sink into primary deficit.",1900-01-01 01:17:59,2015-04-24 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,let me also remind you colleagues that greece is not a country that has been idling around over the last five years doing nothing in order to help itself and to deal with its major problems. we are the champions of fiscal consolidation in the era of peace time. our reduction of structural deficit has been monumental. of course there were many social costs and economic costs as you all know.,1900-01-01 01:18:33,2015-04-24 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"i don’t need to go into this again, but just hearing the various views around this table today someone who doesn’t know the history of the last five years will be mistaken into thinking that greece has been sitting on its hands doing nothing. there has been wasted time since the 20th_february and 24th of february eurogroup agreement. our idea of how to implement that agreement, and it was one as jeroen knows well, that we tried to communicate, was very simple.",1900-01-01 01:19:08,2015-04-24 00:00:00

yanis varoufakis,"let me remind you colleagues that we were elected after a bank run had already begun, speaking of liquidity. our idea was that we should agree on a sustainable dynamically consistent fiscal plan and four or five major reform bills that could be pushed through parliament by now or by may. so as to show some action to our peoples, the greek people, the lithuanian people, the slovak people. everyone.",1900-01-01 01:20:11,2015-04-24 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"instead, we embarked upon, and i understand the reasons, there are institutional reasons for that, a full and comprehensive review. time and again, the greek government attempted to table very specific policy proposals. but time and again, we were told that this must await the complete and comprehensive review.",1900-01-01 01:20:44,2015-04-24 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"so my austrian friend will permit me to say, that it is not true that we did not table proposals. some of them were actually, against our will, leaked to financial times. another colleague spoke of a deja vu. we have that sensation too. the idea now of returning to the failed process of the troika where technocrats visit ministries and discuss with ministers. that was a model that was utilized in the past which made the greek population, independently of what we may want as ministers or as the cabinet, made the greek population very hostile to this process and this is why we agreed on the brussels group and athens group um, dual mechanism.",1900-01-01 01:21:08,2015-04-24 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"i believe that the commission, from what i hear from them, was very much in support of this mechanism. i do also believe that it is right that in the european union ministers should be negotiating with ministers and not be interrogated by technocrats. i believed that we had settled this. as far as the efficiency of the process is concerned, i shall come back to this in one second. i won’t be long jeroen.",1900-01-01 01:22:01,2015-04-24 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"i just want to mention a couple of points. firstly to my slovak colleague, i understand your point about your pensioners but let me tell you that the direction of change matters perhaps matters more than the absolute level. it is one thing to deny pensioners pension rights, it’s quite another to have had what we have had, a sequence of pay reductions.",1900-01-01 01:22:33,2015-04-24 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"similarly, with a minimum wage, we would never imagine of increasing the minimum wage now if it hadn’t been reduced to the extent it has. but even that we have put on the back burner. we are prepared to leave this in abeyance until we negotiate. on the question of liquidity, a colleague mentioned that, suggested or opined that the liquidity problem we have is a natural economic adjustment. let me beg to differ colleagues. the greek state lives within its means.",1900-01-01 01:23:00,2015-04-24 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"has been doing so for a year now. we have a small but nevertheless positive primary surplus. the liquidity problem that we are facing is not due to the fact that we are over–living beyond our means, it is due to the fact that we are in a program which has certain redemptions, repayments particular to the imf during these months, that have been scheduled.",1900-01-01 01:23:34,2015-04-24 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"and certain scheduled disbursements which of course have been suspended for reasons that you all know. we have been meeting those repayments out of the flesh and blood of our own state’s liquidity. this is why we have a liquidity difficulty at the moment. we have been meeting, we’ve been scraping the bottom of the barrel of our state’s resources in order to be meeting repayments to the imf and to other creditors which were meant, according to the program, to the previous program, to the existing program, call it what you might, were meant to be covered by disbursements.",1900-01-01 01:23:59,2015-04-24 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"if you annualise the repayments that my ministry has made to creditors over the last two months, you will come to an astounding sum of 14.2 percent of gdp having come out of the fabric of the greek state to meet those repayments. but without, simply because i do not want to carry on along those lines and burden you further, let me say that we can make this work. that plan b should not be mentioned. it is highly and immoderately anti-european even to bring about this discussion.",1900-01-01 01:24:36,2015-04-24 00:00:00

jeroen dijsselbloem,"it also, means, for example, we still  that one aspect of backtracking on a number of measures, can and will be done, uh, because they have to be tested on economic principle, et cetera, by the institutions as agreed on 20th_february. so, that’s point one. point two is, uh, i would like a confirmation from yanis that the greek government is open to redesign the process because the way that things are going now, fragmented in different places, uh, the tremendous struggle to even get data, et cetera, has to stop.",1900-01-01 01:26:38,2015-04-24 00:00:00
jeroen dijsselbloem,"and we can talk details, uh, outside of this meeting, but we need a certain and comprehensive approach to the process. uh, thirdly, i’m worried about what you say about the fiscal plan and the number of, a couple of reforms. we agreed from the beginning, and this is crucial to all of us, that there has to be a comprehensive deal on what should be put in place in these four months till the end of june, to have a chance of a positive conclusion with a comprehensive package, not just a couple of reforms.",1900-01-01 01:27:19,2015-04-24 00:00:00

yanis varoufakis,"i take it, do you want me to respond now? on the question of process, we are quite happy to discuss a revamping of the process in a way that makes, uh, the convergence more likely, but i must insist that the old ways of the troika visits in athens, uh, have had their day. at least that is what i believe my mandate is from my prime minister and from the greek government. i also believe that this was the view of the european commission and maybe we can be enlightened on this.",1900-01-01 01:28:31,2015-04-24 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"secondly, on the question of, uh, backtracking, we are committed, during the negotiation not to make any moves that will jeopardize the negotiation. our understanding of backtracking may be, of roll, uh, back or of rollback as it’s also called me be quite different. we don’t believe, for instance, that canceling pension reductions, very rapid pension de- reductions in the middle of this crisis as we speak constitutes any kind of rollback, but we are not going to move on until the negotiation has, uh, been completed, we will respect the process. um, and the final question was?",1900-01-01 01:28:31,2015-04-24 00:00:00

jeroen dijsselbloem,"so, uh, i will need also, uh, an undogm- undogmatic approach there. and thirdly, um, all the approach of the comprehensiveness, you have again and again said, uh, and needed for a part deal, let’s do something first. and again and again, we’ve said, we need to have an agreement on the comprehensiveness on the whole issue. so we know what we can expect from each other over this, this period of extension. so, um, please, i need a little more responsiveness on what we’re saying here.",1900-01-01 01:32:10,2015-04-24 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"on the comprehensiveness issue, as i said, it is a mere suggestion. if, uh, colleagues believe that we should put everything in abeyance until the whole process is complete, we will go along with that. on the question of backtracking, we’re quite happy to accept that until the negotiation converges to a complete agreement, there will be no backtracking as you defined it. we have a different view of what a rollback means, but that is simply at the realm of interpretation.",1900-01-01 01:32:55,2015-04-24 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"on the question of the process, i want you to clarify something for me. are you putting it to me that it is incumbent upon the greek government to accept the return to the original troika process as it was being, uh, implemented and as it unfolded prior to our election?",1900-01-01 01:33:37,2015-04-24 00:00:00

speaker 2,"uh, the liquidity condition of banks remain extremely strained and fragile. um, deposit outflows have accelerated, uh, following, uh, the last eurogroup meeting, uh, on the 24th of april. this influx reflects the decree on cash pulling of, uh, government of public sector deposits, uh, which is in itself not an unwelcome development. it’s just a mechanical consequence of, uh, public sector entities withdrawing money from their bank account, which is fine. and, uh, and uh, consistent with the, uh, uh, general objective of ensuring the solvency of the state. but it also reflects, uh, deposit uncertainty.",1900-01-01 00:06:53,2015-05-11 00:00:00

speaker 2,"uh, direct discussions with relevant ministers, uh, would have been desirable. and this is not only a question of efficiency, but also a question of ownership by the, uh, various ministers. so it’s crucial, uh, that the brussels group discussions has a backing from the entire, uh, government. turning to substance, uh, we’ve seen progress in, now in some of the existing policy differences, uh, that relates to the macro economic collections for ’15 and ’16 as pierre has said, had said, uh, where it should not be too difficult to agree on the common deadline. uh, also, the authorities have shown openness to consider a significant simplification of the vat, uh, system for reducing the number of freights and limiting the exemptions.",1900-01-01 00:09:31,2015-05-11 00:00:00

speaker 2,"so again, this is a scenario where that can be pluses and minuses, but, uh, we, uh, we, we have to discuss the pluses and not only minuses. uh, regarding product market reform, uh, the government’s policy intentions still lack, uh, ambition and fall short of the program, uh, requirements. uh, and we also believe that the government should move ahead with the social welfare review and, uh, consider the national  guaranteed minimum income scheme. that is a very important point, uh, because that is about achieving fairness, uh, uh, in the structural reform, uh, program.",1900-01-01 00:12:36,2015-05-11 00:00:00
speaker 2,"and, uh, we believe that fairness would be better ensured through a, uh, a, an overlay, uh, general scheme done by, uh, twisting all, uh, individual reforms, uh, toward the distribution, toward the distribution and fairness would be better achieved, uh, through a, uh, uh, uh, uh, a general scheme, uh, uh, allowing other reforms to focus on, uh, on efficiency. um, so taking all of these together, uh, there has been a narrowing of differences in the limited number of areas. uh, policy gaps remain large, uh, in others. and the conclusion is that that’s still, uh, a considerable distance, uh, of conclusions of the review.",1900-01-01 00:13:12,2015-05-11 00:00:00

poul mathias thomsen,"i think it’s important that we are open about this in lieu of the urgency of the situation and the need to be sure that the process does not become an obstacle to a timely conclusion. the main remaining problem is that ministers responsible for policy implementation are still not participating in the discussion. no minister have yet been to, eh, included in the deliberations in brussels, uh, in, in the brussels group. as a result, while technical experts finally joined the discussion as last week, they too often still do not have sufficient political gui- political guidance and the information received at the technical and political levels is sometime inconsistent.",1900-01-01 00:15:07,2015-05-11 00:00:00
poul mathias thomsen,"moreover, eh, it’s been one of the commitments by negotiators in brussels are still offer being contradicted by public statements or, or drafting legislation by line ministers in athens. i think bringing ministers to the table would help overcome these problems. in any case, and i, it’s important for me to stress that fund management will need to be assured before endorsing a program that ministers responsible for implementation support the agreed policies. again, we do agree that the process improved no-notably, and this is why we are making some progress.",1900-01-01 00:15:48,2015-05-11 00:00:00
poul mathias thomsen,"so on the issue of substance, eh, i think there has been progress so far in a, in a, in, in three areas. on the vat reforms, eh, the authorities have, have suggested that they might consider to broaden the base by sign- essentially unifying tax rates with a few exceptions. they still need to indicate that they have sup- political support for this option and agree on tax rates and limitations on exemptions that ensure a notable positive revenue efect. but i think it’s fair to say that this is emerging as one of the potentially more promising areas for common ground for major reforms.",1900-01-01 00:16:26,2015-05-11 00:00:00
poul mathias thomsen,"secondly, on the autonomy of revenue administration, this is an area where the authorities initially reversed reforms, uh, that had been made in the past to increase autonomy, including by adopting legislation that, that established in effect, the panel of tax administration undermine the effectiveness of the tax administration and increase the room for political int-interference. i think they … it’s clear signals that they intend on changing course. uh, and, and, and, and, and understands the importance of a more autonomous agency.",1900-01-01 00:17:11,2015-05-11 00:00:00
poul mathias thomsen,"here too, we still need to specify concrete critical details, but this also is an area where i see signs that we could agree on significant reforms. third, insolvency framework. the authorities committed to undertake a series of reforms of the insolvency framework and, and, uh, and they have provided a draft strategy. here too, critical details need to be specified and agreed within a comprehensive framework. so this is, this is good news. uh, uh, uh, it is, it, it’s good news that we have progress in these areas. as others pointed out, it’s, it’s the progress on, uh, on broad objectives and principles and we need, we still need to agree on how to get, on how to achieve it. what are the concrete details?",1900-01-01 00:17:40,2015-05-11 00:00:00
poul mathias thomsen,"in all the areas, however, including some of the most important ones, we have not made much progress and policy differences remains significant. on the 2015 budget, there are still some differences of views with regard to what should be the primary surplus target for 2015, but the more important difference is that the authorities appear to believe that the fiscal targets can be achieved without any significant additional concrete measures requiring legislative changes. while we are still in the early stages, uh, uh, the authorities appear to believe that these targets can be achieved largely to efficiency measures.",1900-01-01 00:18:27,2015-05-11 00:00:00
poul mathias thomsen,"uh, uh, and, and, and as i said that there’s no need for, for, for, for parametric or legislative changes. this is simply not realistic given greece’s extremely weak administrative capacity and poor historical performance with sorts of administrative measures. the government needs to stand ready to undertake structural fiscal reforms that involves  changes approved by parliament. in this regard, as we have said before, tax rates have already been increased too much on a narrow base and all other expenditures and pensions have already been cut to what is likely to improve unsustainably low levels.",1900-01-01 00:19:06,2015-05-11 00:00:00

poul mathias thomsen,"uh, in most of these areas, the s- in all of these mentioned areas, the authorities are significantly backtracking, reversing policies already in place or saying the intent to reverse policies already in place and going back on program commitments about the future. we understand and i want to be clear about that. we understand that the authorities acknowledged that no reforms are not an option and that they, the point to them is that they want to do things differently and we of course accepted. but generally they have not told us … they, they have told us what they do not want to do, but they have not told us what they want to do.",1900-01-01 00:20:31,2015-05-11 00:00:00

yanis varoufakis,"thank you very much jorun. uh, let me start also, uh, with a comment on leaks. um, it would be good if there were none, but if there are leaks, it would be good if they were accurate. i never heard paul thompson, uh, discuss, uh, debt restructuring,  in riga and i never had any one of you, uh, hurl abuse at me or personal insults despite what was, uh, um, widely reported in the press. so please, no leaks. but if you leak, if anybody leaks, they might as well be accurate with the leaks. now, colleagues, over the last, uh, three months and especially after the 20th_february, eurogroup agreement, we’ve been striving to find common ground between the pre-existing program and our government’s priorities.",1900-01-01 00:26:09,2015-05-11 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"it hasn’t been easy for reasons that were mostly political, but also partly to do with process, technical. a very belief comment here because, uh, several, uh, representatives of the, uh, institutions mentioned it, how it will expedite the process if ministers were part of the brussels group. let me say that this is something that, uh, uh, we have very strong views about and which we have discussed with the commission in particular – ministers only talk to ministers. and this is a principle that we have to abide by. it’s the principle of, uh, the greek government, which i’m simply mandated to convey to you now.",1900-01-01 00:27:02,2015-05-11 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"now, nevertheless, we believe that the last fortnight as was said here by others, has produced substantial progress, partly because of a tightened negotiating process that removed procedural inefficiencies, but primarily because of major concessions on the greek side. agreement has not been reached, despite the substantial convergence achieved. the institutions wish to suggest that this imperfect convergence may be due to our, uh, reluctance to move further. our side could retort that convergence has not been reached, because the agreement point has, has not, uh, appeared on the horizon due to the stance of the institutions.",1900-01-01 00:27:41,2015-05-11 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"but it would be imprudent to enter into such a fruitless exchange at the moment. this eurogroup meeting must help the negotiations move onward toward a successful outcome and refrain from anything that may impede that progress. this is what our mandate is at this crucial time for our currency union, for our country. so in this spirit, in the spirit of helping the process along, it is important and right that the substantial progress that has been made and the substantial concessions by our side be acknowledged in our communicate today.",1900-01-01 00:28:27,2015-05-11 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"we have, as you heard, moved very substantially towards an independent tax authority. we have tabled particularly radical views of this, radical by the standards of any great government. let me refer to something that was said. i think it was paul that said it about backtracking there initially. it’s a very simple situation. the tax authority that the, that the general secretary for public revenues is part of my ministry. i am politically responsible for it. it has a quasi autonomous, um, existence at the moment, which means that i have political responsibility for what it does without having any authority over it.",1900-01-01 00:29:08,2015-05-11 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"to enhance its autonomy while retaining the responsibility of the minister is to have responsibility without authority. and that is not something that is like, i think it wouldn’t be acceptable to any of you. so this is why i suggested let’s go the whole hog. let’s render it, let’s just excise it completely from my ministry, thick walls of my ministry and turn it into a fully independent authority like the irs for instance, which is answerable to parliament. i won’t bother you further with this. i think that we have a very good understanding of this with, with the institutions.",1900-01-01 00:29:49,2015-05-11 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"on the question of the npls, there’s been significant progress towards convergence agreement on this question. on vat, it was, um, our side that initiated the discussion about harmonizing, having two different rates and rationalizing the system, the question of pinning down precisely what those rates must be. and i’m here referring to something that paul said, um, is something that we’ll have to do very carefully so as to ensure that on the one hand, yes paul, you’re right, we have to increase the, the, the vat, uh, take. but secondly, we must not make assumptions that, uh, raise the top rate too high and have the opposite effect.",1900-01-01 00:30:24,2015-05-11 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"if at the moment we assume zero elasticity and we simply, um, pitch the top rate where it would have to be, if there was no increase in sales and vat collection, then we will end up with such a high rate, the top rate, that we will, we will be doing damage to the potential tax state. so this is something that we really need to study properly and not simply, um, leave to horse trading at the brussels group over a period of a few hours. this is very serious business, as i’m sure everybody agrees.",1900-01-01 00:31:10,2015-05-11 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"on the questions of pensions, our government has moved away from the 13th pension idea for people, for pensioners below 700 and towards targeting, um, pensioners below the poverty line and targeting them efficiently. uh, i know that the term 13th pension jars with lots of you. in our culture, it doesn’t, because it wasn’t really a 13th pension. it was simply a way of calculating annual payments, uh, in terms of simply giving more installments. uh, i think that there’s significant pro-, um, uh, progress there.",1900-01-01 00:31:46,2015-05-11 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"now the idea that it’s kind of backtracking to eliminate the zero deficit clause that the previous government accepted and introduced, we would like to challenge that. i don’t want to bother you too much with this, but we have a view that city, simply cutting down pensions is not informing them. maybe we need to cut them down. but to reform the pension system, we have to render it sustainable. and that means finding ways of boosting employment. very importantly, reducing undeclared labor, which is now around one third of all paid labor.",1900-01-01 00:32:24,2015-05-11 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"and you can understand that th- … th-th-that number is just horrific. no pension system can really be rendered sustainable when you’ve got a third of paid laborers, employees, um, undeclared in the black market, so to speak. um, we certainly are moving towards closing down all the windows that are making earlier diamonds, not only possible, but also, um, a method by which certain corporations and companies are pushing workers off their payroll onto the pension fund system.",1900-01-01 00:33:05,2015-05-11 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"uh, on the question of the greek statistical office, they’ll start. uh, we have drafted legisla- legislation that increases transparency, um, and accountability. these two have to go together. you can’t have an independent statistical office if it is not accountable and transparent. now on the question, let me just say that other questions of macroeconomic focus that paul referred to, i think we have significant convergence on the, of the two sides. our focus of, of real gdp growth for 2015 differs from that of institutions only marginally, i would say within the realm of statistical error.",1900-01-01 00:33:40,2015-05-11 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"and the real difference is not so much about nominal gdp, but it’s about the deflation rate. if we agree on the rate of deflation, then we will get much closer on the, o-o-on the real gdp growth. and this is important because our rate of deflation at the moment has been exacerbated by the standoff and the liquidity squeeze. it’s a monetary phenomenon as everybody knows. now, besides the importance of acknowledging these concessions and their contribution to the conversions that we’ve all observed, it is also important to ensure that our communicate today plays a role in securing the advances we’ve made so far.",1900-01-01 00:34:20,2015-05-11 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"and preventing any untoward events that might cause unnecessary plo-problems both for greece and more broadly. i’m referring of course to my government’s capacity to function and to meet its obligations while the negotiations continue. let me remind you colleagues that even though we have no market access, we haven’t had market access for a very long while, and we have no disbursements for eight months now. our government is continuing to meet all its obligations to international creditors. we will be doing again this tomorrow morning.",1900-01-01 00:35:05,2015-05-11 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"indeed, our government, since our election has made payments to international creditors without market access or disbursements amounting to 14% of gdp in annualized terms. this is quite an extraordinary effort that must be acknowledged, together with an acknowledgment that these payments have been made at the expense of a virtual cessation of payments to local greek creditors of the government, for instance, to suppliers of the greek state. in addition, as is well known and i think benoit mentioned it, we have dipped into every available reserve of the greek, of the general gre-greek government, be it the health service, universities, willing municipalities, et cetera. now, this extraordinary effort to fulfill our obligations to the imf primarily and other creditors must receive its the acknowledgment in today’s communicate. on several occasions, we have been assured that as long as there is, as there is progress in the negotiations and convergence, the greek state will have access to the liquidity necessary to carry on with its essential functions.",1900-01-01 00:35:39,2015-05-11 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"i believe it is beyond the out that the negotiations have been progressing well enough to justify our expectation that the assurances that are just mentioned concerning our liquidity be upheld. now, let me inform you colleagues that this is not quite so at the moment. we have now reached the point, as we speak, where the slightest perturbation in our tax revenues from a day to day basis or in our expenditures … let me give you an example: suppose there is an extensive forest fire of the kind that will become forthcoming soon, given the change in seasons. any such perturbation may well cause an accident.",1900-01-01 00:36:48,2015-05-11 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"also, and this is important having dipped into se-, so many organizations reserves, we run a serious risk that essential services may be jeopardized by unforeseen, yet not improbable events. in short, the assurance that as long as there is progress in the negotiations, the greek state will have access to the liquidity necessary to carry on with its essential functions is currently not fulfilled, i’m afraid. it is for this reason and with the view to allowing the negotiations to converge fully into an agreement point that our government requests of today’s eurogroup, that our communicate contains whatever phraseology  is necessary to allow the relevant institutions to top up our state’s liquidity to a level consistent with the reassurances i just mentioned.",1900-01-01 00:37:26,2015-05-11 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"lastly, let me ask a question that no one has asked me in this context out of courtesy, i think, but which i’m sure that many of you have on your mind. if our liquidity is so low, why don’t we just move faster in the negotiations? why do we not bridge the gap on the outstanding issues much more quickly? i’m sure this is the question that most of you have in your mind. let me answer this question, colleagues, that the answer is that we had determined that the agreement, which will result from these negotiations will be wind that we shall see through.",1900-01-01 00:38:17,2015-05-11 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"that we shall be able to look at you in the eye at the time of signing the agreement and genuinely say, “we, the greek government, can do this,” but the see this, we must believe that the fiscal targets, the pension labor market reforms, the product market reforms and so on, that all those parts, elements of the agreement, will be targets that we can reach maybe with a huge effort. not maybe, definitely with a huge efforts and it would be the forms that we can excite the greek people into supporting, unlike the previous unhappy experience with the programs reform agendas.",1900-01-01 00:38:55,2015-05-11 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"so signing off on an agreement that we do not think is right, that we do not think will achieve the greek targets would be an act of dishonesty to our partners, to you, and to our people. i have no doubt that no one in this room would want us to sign off, uh, dishonestly. repeating mistakes and misdemeanors that past greek governments committed. so to conclude, much prog-progress has been made. more progress is necessary. we can reach an agreement soon. but to get there, we need a communicate this evening that creates the right atmosphere both in here and outside and allows all of us, including the institutions, to do what it takes to smooth in the bath to the agreement point that i’m sure we’ll, we all want. thank you jeroen.",1900-01-01 00:39:35,2015-05-11 00:00:00

mario draghi,"and, uh, no it’s very unlikely they would stay the way… it already started by the way moving up over, uh, recent time. uh, one has to understand that with very low interest rates, the potential for uncertainty, and very high volatility is higher than at high interest rates.",1900-01-01 00:09:02,2015-06-18 00:00:00
mario draghi,"because when- when the interest rates are very low, and around zero, even  interest rates all along the curve.",1900-01-01 00:09:13,2015-06-18 00:00:00
mario draghi,"and so anything that might affect expectations of higher interest rates in the short term, would have an effect quite magnified over longer term interest rates, so…",1900-01-01 00:09:29,2015-06-18 00:00:00
mario draghi,"and the same thing holds for inflation expectations of course. they would, would reverberate on interest rates. so that’s why it certainly should be properly taken into account in the stability programs, by- by the various governments. thank you.",1900-01-01 00:09:40,2015-06-18 00:00:00
jeroen dijsselbloem,thank you.  discussion.,1900-01-01 00:09:55,2015-06-18 00:00:00
thomas wieser,"thanks very much. um, i think we’ve already very, very, a complete, uh, description, and uh, uh,  graphs of the nature of- of- of the issue.",1900-01-01 00:10:08,2015-06-18 00:00:00
thomas wieser,"uh, we had a very, very good, uh, discussion of this. and i think, uh, , uh, quite openness to discuss that, uh, further. um, it was i think here emphasized, uh, by many of the colleagues, uh, that what we were looking at in terms of pure interest rate reductions does not reflect the net savings, budget. because, uh, very often, uh, especially in this low inflation environment, you will also have, uh, cyclically, uh, lower revenues.",1900-01-01 00:10:22,2015-06-18 00:00:00
thomas wieser,", uh, on the debt structure, maturity structure. uh, and also, uh, the structure of course of government assets.",1900-01-01 00:10:55,2015-06-18 00:00:00
thomas wieser,"but, um, if one turns to the use, uh, of such  policy responses, i would say it became, uh, fairly clear, uh, that there’s support for the idea that the higher, uh, government deficits, and government, uh, debt levels are, the more such windfall profits should be used for fiscal consolidation.",1900-01-01 00:11:22,2015-06-18 00:00:00
thomas wieser,"and the lower, uh, they are, the more likely it is that they should be used, uh, for the, uh, government, uh, investment projects. uh, clear emphasis .",1900-01-01 00:11:49,2015-06-18 00:00:00
thomas wieser,"and, uh, if one, uh, looks over one’s shoulder, uh, what have we experienced so far? uh, there are two ways of looking at identical, uh, . one could say that so far, by and large windfalls appear to be largely not, uh, used, uh, for, uh, budgetary consolidation.",1900-01-01 00:12:24,2015-06-18 00:00:00
thomas wieser,"you could also say that, uh, by and large, uh, windfalls, uh, have been, uh, been used in an anti-cyclical, uh, manner. thereby pushing the effect, uh, of, er, , uh, of the downturn, the cycle.",1900-01-01 00:12:37,2015-06-18 00:00:00

speaker 3,"thank you, jeroen. uh, actually the debate has already gone a long way in pointing out pitfalls and opportunities of low interest rate environment. i would start from mario’s point, which, uh, should set, uh, framework for all policy decisions related to lower interest rates.",1900-01-01 00:13:32,2015-06-18 00:00:00
speaker 3,"that lower interest rates are not here for to stay forever. at some stage we will see some return to some normal state of- of the world, including interest rates that are a little bit higher at least.",1900-01-01 00:13:56,2015-06-18 00:00:00
speaker 3,"uh, so this to me, uh, suggests that the lower interest rate environment should be seen  a- a weaker euro, uh better inflationary expectations, and of course easier monetary provisions.",1900-01-01 00:14:10,2015-06-18 00:00:00
speaker 3,"and therefore the first- the first, uh, implication i would draw for policy is, uh, since there is a window of opportunity, which by definition will close up sooner than expected possibly, please let’s all not make the mistake of not exploiting that window of opportunity by pushing forward the  programs that in many, our- our cases, certainly in my case if i may, uh, is very much at the center of the agenda.",1900-01-01 00:14:29,2015-06-18 00:00:00
speaker 3,"this is a very general point, which does not relate to technicalities of the fiscal implications.",1900-01-01 00:14:58,2015-06-18 00:00:00
speaker 3,"second, this has been mentioned by both, and i will not dwell on it. but it’s very important. what can we do to, uh, help, uh, institutional investors do better in such an environment?",1900-01-01 00:15:03,2015-06-18 00:00:00
speaker 3,"of course the assumption that these low rates will go away at some stage, will have to impact on long term investment decisions. so it’s not just, uh, it’s not that straight forward how, what are the implications for institutional investors? although i very much subscribe to the view that more, uh… a larger choice set, let me put it that way. a larger choice set should be allowed to these investors.",1900-01-01 00:15:16,2015-06-18 00:00:00
speaker 3,"having said that, but then pierre pointed out very clearly, of course the lower interest rates come along with an environment, where nominal growth, both nominal and real growth are lower, and inflation is also, uh, not high enough.",1900-01-01 00:15:16,2015-06-18 00:00:00
speaker 3,"so from that point of view, of course the impact on public finance of- of, uh, nom- a low nominal growth en- en- environment, has other implications. one must mention that- that it has caused an implication on revenues, which themselves would be lower.",1900-01-01 00:15:57,2015-06-18 00:00:00
speaker 3,"and this of course, uh, adds to the environment as, uh, the benchmark against which we have to assess. but also another point maybe worth mentioning, that while we have lower interest rates on- on government debt for a number of reasons, it is not always obvious to what extent this is transmitted to other interest rates in the market, to what extent there is a channel  in terms of easier financial conditions or not. this may work both ways. but, uh, it’s also important to, uh, to take that into account.",1900-01-01 00:16:12,2015-06-18 00:00:00
speaker 3,"coming to the point that was central in the presentation very quickly, uh, what should we do with that space that is generated by lower nominal, uh, interest rates?",1900-01-01 00:16:48,2015-06-18 00:00:00
speaker 3,"a- apart from measurement problems, how do we exactly measure the additional fiscal space generated by lower rates? which has to do with the well known problems of measuring the impact, uh, on, uh, uh, uh, w- what is the cyclical impact? what is the impact of cyclical conditions on potential output, uh, coming from that, uh, just, uh, ?",1900-01-01 00:16:58,2015-06-18 00:00:00
speaker 3,"i want to conclude with, uh, two lessons that i would, uh, draw. one, uh… actually three lessons. one is, uh, yes that, uh, the, uh, amount of resources, uh, freed up by that window, should, uh, be devoted to, uh, making your fiscal stance stronger.",1900-01-01 00:17:20,2015-06-18 00:00:00
speaker 3,"uh, which however can be seen in a number of ways. not only, uh, uh, not only, uh, moderating your spending, but also modifying the composition of your spending towards more capital investment, which in many cases is complementary to the structure .",1900-01-01 00:17:40,2015-06-18 00:00:00
speaker 3,and of course i very much subscribe to  quoting you if i may.,1900-01-01 00:17:59,2015-06-18 00:00:00
speaker 3,"um, the other point, and i’m finished, is that there is, uh, and opportunity with lower interest rates to improve debt management. to take benefit of the immediate lower cost of funding for the budget. and so to, uh, reassess the structure of your funding, your- your debt management, which will be helpful once at some stage the interest rate environment will be higher.",1900-01-01 00:18:13,2015-06-18 00:00:00
speaker 3,"so this is an additional element we should be taking into account, into asking what can we do to use that space, in order to improve our fiscal sustainability? thank you.",1900-01-01 00:18:40,2015-06-18 00:00:00
jeroen dijsselbloem,"thanks very much  different perspective perhaps, or a different country to reflect on the same.",1900-01-01 00:18:49,2015-06-18 00:00:00

alexander stubb,"and climbing aboard the institution, i feel very privileged to be here. and i guess in my previous capacity, um, uh, as pm, i sort of felt that i was jack of all trades, but master of none. now suddenly i feel i have to be here as a master of lower interest rate environment windfall.",1900-01-01 00:19:46,2015-06-18 00:00:00
alexander stubb,"uh, so i feel quite humbled to make this intervention. if i sound good, you should probably thank  next to me. if i sound bad, you know that my learning curve is still quite steep.",1900-01-01 00:20:03,2015-06-18 00:00:00
alexander stubb,"uh, i’ll be quite brief looking at this issue, uh, from the finnish perspective, by making basically, uh, three, uh, general, uh, remarks. obviously we agree with the conclusions of the commission. but the remarks are- are pretty much on the analysis, uh, side.",1900-01-01 00:20:14,2015-06-18 00:00:00
alexander stubb,"the, uh, first, uh, remark is that we see, much as the previous speakers, the decline of interest rates coming from two different aspects, and thus having probably, uh, two different implications.",1900-01-01 00:20:33,2015-06-18 00:00:00
alexander stubb,"so the two reasons are, one is the retreat of the sovereign debt crisis, which has obviously  at least until, uh, last week. uh, and- and it’s helped all the risk countries. there’s no question about that. but then it hasn’t affected the non-risk countries that much.",1900-01-01 00:20:47,2015-06-18 00:00:00
alexander stubb,"and the other reason is obviously low growth, uh, where, uh the key role uh, has pretty much affected all of us in- in one way or another. i assume that in this role you’re not supposed to comment about the ecb, ecb that’s why i’ve always given my full support to what the ecb has done, not least in quantitative easing, not least in keeping actually interest rates low, and trying to get our, uh, economies going. so some benefit from both, and others from just one.",1900-01-01 00:21:07,2015-06-18 00:00:00
alexander stubb,"now, a second point is what kind of effects does this have? um, i guess if it’s linked to the prices, uh, this was said i think quite eloquently by the italian minister. then we should try to reduce, use the moment to try to reduce, uh, debt right now.",1900-01-01 00:21:35,2015-06-18 00:00:00
alexander stubb,"then on the other hand if it’s linked to growth, my question is, is it really windfall ?",1900-01-01 00:21:54,2015-06-18 00:00:00
alexander stubb,"the final point is very much from a finnish perspective. i guess the report looks very much at the debt side, uh, debt . but in finland i guess is a slightly different case. because for us we’re in a situation whereby we have public assets, much more than debt. i think the ratio is something, our debt is, uh, 100 billion euros, uh, and our public assets approximate to 185.",1900-01-01 00:22:06,2015-06-18 00:00:00

luis de guindos,"so real interest rates, uh, are real- are really, uh, uh, uh, higher than nominal interest rates. so, uh, you know there is a- a parallel evolution of nominal interest rates, and inflation expectation, and actual inflation- inflation rates.",1900-01-01 00:23:25,2015-06-18 00:00:00
luis de guindos,"even if we look at, uh, the impact on the fiscal policy, it’s obvious that, uh, lower nominal interest rates have any positive impact on the evolution of the, uh, of the- of the- of the deficit, on the expenditure side. but simultaneously very low, uh, uh, inflation rates, and very low, uh, nominal gdp growth rates also have an impact, a relative impact.",1900-01-01 00:23:42,2015-06-18 00:00:00
luis de guindos,"so, i think that we are going to live a process of normalization. i think that nominal interest rates will go up, in parallel with the evolution of inflation expectations. and, uh, well, we have had a windfall profit, let’s say because of the low environment, or the environment of low interest rates.",1900-01-01 00:24:11,2015-06-18 00:00:00
luis de guindos,"but simultaneously, simultaneously i think that higher nominal growth rates will be a helping hand for tax revenues. and this is something that we have to take into consideration.",1900-01-01 00:24:31,2015-06-18 00:00:00
jeroen dijsselbloem,"thank you. uh, other colleagues? no? um, i think that was, a very, uh, very good discussion. i want to thank the commission for the preparatory work, and- and pierre’s presentation. um, pierre i could not see in the, um, in the sheets that i have, i could see where the, um, fall in interest payments is for the different countries. but i couldn’t see how different countries had used that windfall.",1900-01-01 00:24:44,2015-06-18 00:00:00
jeroen dijsselbloem,"you made the point that many countries, uh, have used it to do less on the expenditure side, but i couldn’t actually see on the sheets. or perhaps there have been sheets for that. i was of course interested to see how my own country was doing, how we had been using this opportunity.",1900-01-01 00:25:17,2015-06-18 00:00:00

yanis varoufakis,"the ekas that pierre mentioned, from the lowest of the low of pensions as the institutions have asked. because that would push the poorest of the poor into grave- d- greater poverty and create a wave of hostility to whatever agreement and r- reform package we agree upon. in our proposals to the institutions we have offered very serious reforms. we’ve offered an extensive, but optimized privatization agenda spanning the period from this year to 2025. we’ve offered, offered, proposed the creation of a fully independent tax and customs authority under the aegis of the provision of parliament so that politicians, uh, but also corporate interests, h- hold no sway over tax collection. we proposed a fiscal council that oversees the state budget, a short-term program for limiting foreclosures and managing non-performing loans, judicial and civil procedural code reforms, liberalizing several product markets and services, am- elimination of many nuisance charges. public administration reforms introducing, for instance, proper staff evaluation systems, reducing non-wage costs, modernizing and unifying public sector payrolls.",1900-01-01 01:36:00,2015-06-18 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"in addition to these reforms, the greek authorities have engaged the oecd to help our government design, implement and monitor a second series of reforms. only yesterday i met with the oecd’s secretary general, mr. gurría, and his team and mine announced a joint reform agenda complete with a specific road map that we’ve, we’ll focus on. a major anti-corruption drive and relevant institutions to support it, especially in the area of procurement. liberalizing the construction sector, including the market and standards of construction materials. wholesale trade liberalization. the unification of, uh, electronic and press codes of practice in the media. one-stop business centers that eradicate the bureaucratic impediments to doing business in greece. help on the front of pension reform, where the emphasis will be on proper long term actuarial studies, the phasing out, almost complete eradication of early retirements; the reduction in the operating costs of the pension funds; pension fund consolidation.",1900-01-01 01:37:22,2015-06-18 00:00:00

yanis varoufakis,"now, briefly allow me to turn back to pensions. much has been made of the fact that the pensions account in greece form more than they did in the past, as much as 16% of gdp. however, consider this: pensions have shrunk by almost 40/45%, and the number of pensions, pensioners, is stable. so expenditure on pensions has fallen but the percentage has increased because gdp has collapsed over the last five years. our alleged backtracking on pension reforms is that we have suspended the further reduction in pensions that have already lost 40% of their value when, and this is important, the prices of goods and services that pensioners need, like pharmaceuticals, have hardly moved. consider this rele- relatively unknown fact: around one million families, that is a very large number in a population of 10 million, survive today on the meager pension of a grandfather or a grandmother as the rest of the family members are unemployed in a country where only 9% of them employed have ever collected any unemployment benefit. diminishing that one solitary pension in those households is tantamount to turning a family into the streets.",1900-01-01 01:40:45,2015-06-18 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"this is why we keep telling the institutions that, “yes. we need pension reform. but, no. we cannot just cut 1% of gdp off pensions through one way or the other without creating substantial hardship and also giving another turn to the wheel of the recessionary forces.” if 1.8 billion is taken out of this economy from the lowest of the low of social strata if you take into consideration the multiplier effects that the imf has con-, uh, confessed in the past to have underestimated. we’re talking about another spin of the deflationary wheel.",1900-01-01 01:42:05,2015-06-18 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"now, i suppose that institutions are asking us to eliminate these solitary, solidarity pensions, the ekas, because already this, the, the, the distribution of pension income has been compressed so much that if you’re going to reduce pension costs today by 1% of gdp you have to attack the lowest of the low of pensions. it can’t be done any other way.",1900-01-01 01:42:46,2015-06-18 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"structural reforms, colleagues, of course, promote b- growth potential, but mere cutbacks in an economy like greece is, promote recession. greece must adjust by introducing genuine reforms, as i said. but, at the same time, going back to doctor blanchard’s que-, uh, answer, or question, i believe the institutions need to adjust their definition of growth enhancing reforms to acknowledge that parametric cuts and tax hikes are not reforms that will help greece today. now, colleagues have remarked in the past in the eurogroup, and i understand that, that our pensions are higher than theirs, and they fear that the greek government may be having designs to ask in the context of a transfer union that we do not have, as pierre said, for your pensioners to be supporting ours. let me be very clear on this. we’re never going to ask you to do this. we’re never going to ask you to subsidize our state, our wages, our pensions, our public en- expenditure. indeed, this is not a transfer union.",1900-01-01 01:43:12,2015-06-18 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"but, colleagues, the greek state has been living within its means for a while. over the past five months we have even managed, despite zero market access and zero disbursements, to repay up to eight billion to our creditors and do intend to keep doing so. now, i understand there are concerns that our government may slip into a primary dece- deficit again. and i think, i, that this is the reason why the institutions are pressing us to accept large vat rises, parametric changes and parametric pension cuts. now, while there’s a view that the announcement of a viable agreement at early next, uh, early next week i, we, one hopes, will suffice to boost economic activity sufficiently to generate a pri- a healthy primary surplus, i understand perfectly well that our creditors, you, may have cause to be skeptical and to want safeguards, an insurance policy against our government’s possible slide into profligacy again.",1900-01-01 01:44:18,2015-06-18 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"this is what i believe lies behind doctor blanchard’s call for the greek government to offer, and i quote, “truly credible measures.” so here comes an idea: what we consider to be a truly credible idea. instead of arguing over half a percentage point of measures or whether these measures should be parametric or, uh, administrative, how about a deeper, more comprehensive, permanent reform? an automated hard deficit break that is legislated and monitored by the independent fiscal council that we, and the institutions, have already agreed upon? the fiscal council would, under this agreement, monitor the state’s budget execution on a week by week basis, issue warnings if a minimum primary surplus target looks like being violated in the foreseeable future and, at some point, the fiscal council, the independent fiscal bo- council could trigger automated across the board horizontal reductions in all state outlays so as to prevent the slide below the pre-agreed threshold for the, for the primary surplus. that way we will have a fail safe system that ensures the solvency of the greek state and its primary surplus while the greek government retates, retains the policy space it needs in order to remain sovereign and able to govern within a democratic context.",1900-01-01 01:45:24,2015-06-18 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"consider this a firm proposal that our government is prepared to implement as part of an immediate agreement. now, given that our government will never again need to borrow from our ta- from your taxpayers or from the taxpayer standing behind the international monetary fund, the debate should now move, or should quickly move, from pensions and vat to the very central question about primary surpluses. how large should they be?",1900-01-01 01:46:57,2015-06-18 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"does anyone seriously believe that the growth rate of an economy like ours who’s been deprived of serious bank credit and investment flows is, uh, independent of the primary targets set? the imf understands fully that the two numbers are linked endogenously. and this is the reason why greece’s public debt must be looked at once again. our large debt overhang should be thought of as a large unfunded tax liability. while it is true that the hfsf and glf slices of our debt are long dated and the interest rate is low, it is also true, colleagues, that the greek state’s unfunded tax liability, our debt, features a lumpy component that impedes investment and recovery today. i am referring here, in particular, to the 27 billions of smp bonds still held by the ecb. now, this is short-dated, unfunded liability that potential investors in greece, even after an agreement has been struck, will take a look at and turn back because they can see the funded gap this part of our debt creates because they recognize that this lump of 27 billion on the books of the ecb stops greece from taking advantage of quantitative easing while, at the same time, creating a short term funding gap.",1900-01-01 01:47:28,2015-06-18 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"it is indeed an irony, perhaps a cruel irony, irony, that the country most afflicted by deflation in the eurozone today, is the one, the only one, effectively, that is excluded from the ecb’s anti-deflation remedy, and it is excluded even after an agreement has been struck because of this lump of 27 million, billion of smp bonds. so our proposal of this front is i, we believe simple, efficient and mutually beneficial. we propose no new monies, not one fresh euro, for our state. no new debt for greece. but imagine the following three part agreement to be announced at a press conference over the next few days.",1900-01-01 01:48:56,2015-06-18 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"part one: the deeper reforms that i mentioned, including the automated hard deficit break that i suggested. second part: a rationalization of greece’s debt repayment schedule along the following lines: first, to effect an smp buy back from the ecb, greece would acquire a new loan facility from the esm, would use it to purchase the smp bonds back from the ecb and to retire them. to underpin this loan, like every loan agreement needs a conditionality, we could agree that the deep reform agenda that will be part of this agreement acts as a common conditionality for successfully completing the current program and for securing the new esm arrangement that comes into operation immediately afterwards and runs concurrently with a continuing imf program until the end of march 2016.",1900-01-01 01:49:40,2015-06-18 00:00:00

jeroen dijsselbloem,"today i think we send a strong signal to the greek authorities that it is up to them to fully engage with the institutions on the base of the aide memoire in the framework of the eurogroup statement of the 20th_february. however, the current agreement, the current agreement expires in less than two weeks. an agreement is still possible but will have to be credible and solid both for the benefit of  those will in general terms be my lines of communication to be used after this meeting. over to your suggestions. wolfgang",1900-01-01 02:22:56,2015-06-18 00:00:00
wolfgang schäuble,"sorry, i think you have rightly mentioned that we should be careful before distribute the so-called aide-mémoire to the eurogroup because then you make it a document that  if you take it now, and you just said, that you want to take the statement as a base, i think we have as a eurogroup, we have to stick to the mou and to the statement of the 11th of february, which was by the way",1900-01-01 02:23:46,2015-06-18 00:00:00
jeroen dijsselbloem,"good point, i will adjust that. i won’t refer to the aide memoire. i’ll take that out ",1900-01-01 02:26:02,2015-06-18 00:00:00
hans jörg schelling,"thank you jeroen. first of all, in my opinion the institutions made a really wide interpretation of the agreement of february and i think that as a point to wolfgang to say this aide memoire was not the statement we made in february. i think it’s a good proposal, so it’s not a critique, but it is a very wide interpretation  in february.",1900-01-01 02:26:18,2015-06-18 00:00:00
hans jörg schelling,"and the second thing, which is important for me, jeroen you say that it is up to the institutions to find a solution is not the work of, by the institutions, it must be done by the eurogroup.",1900-01-01 02:26:55,2015-06-18 00:00:00
jeroen dijsselbloem,"on your two points. first of all, what i certainly didn’t want is to trigger a discussion now about the aide memoire and whether that is inside or outside the framework of the 20th_february. i don’t think we are in a position to judge, um, strictly speaking we haven’t  the document um, so let’s leave that aside.",1900-01-01 02:27:47,2015-06-18 00:00:00
jeroen dijsselbloem,"the second point is that, quite rightly, if there is no agreement there are also decisions to be taken and you can be sure that we will act and we will prepare and the institutions are also preparing other scenarios, so you are not quite right when you say that other scenarios are not for the institutions to prepare but for us  but a lot of work will also have simply have to be done by the institutions even without our explicit decision. but in either scenario, work is ahead of us, that is for sure. let me also say that if there is to be a eurozone summit, which i don’t know, this is not up to us to decide, if there is to be such a leaders’ meeting, that must be and will be prepared by the eurogroup. this is also in the rules and regulations, eurozone summits will be prepared by the eurogroup. so our involvement doesn’t stop here, that’s for sure. our involvement is crucial and will stay crucial. yanis.",1900-01-01 02:28:07,2015-06-18 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"regarding the communication issue and the press conference that you are going to be giving, allow me to say that placing the onus squarely and entirely on the greek side, and not on the side of the institutions or of the rest of the eurozone, seems to us rather disingenuous. especially given the fact that, as michel sapin said, we are all responsible as elected leaders and this is certainly not the end of the road.",1900-01-01 02:29:16,2015-06-18 00:00:00
jeroen dijsselbloem,"i think we are going to come to an end of our discussion. i don’t think  and luis, but, um, i think that also for communication reasons it is time that we come to an end of our discussion. luis first and then peter.",1900-01-01 02:31:41,2015-06-18 00:00:00
luis de guindos,"yanis, nobody wants to trigger any sort of accidents, so i would not play that kind of game but the reality is the reality and the reaction of the market is going to be there. this is not a question about leaks or not leaks. this is a question about the reality that we have to confront over the next, the next days. so, i think that we are reaching, you know, we are coming to a head and i think that there are some events that are out of our control. so i think that we should have also a communication just to deal with this situation.",1900-01-01 02:31:58,2015-06-18 00:00:00
luis de guindos,"i suppose that tomorrow the reaction of the markets will not be positive, i suppose that the reaction of greek depositors will not be positive, well it already has not been according to the  by mario draghi, and this is something that we have to bear in mind, because this is the reality, this is the reality. so, i think that, jeroen, you should prepare, you know, any sort of communication in order to make sure that, you know, in any potential scenario, we are going to confront and that the integrity and irrevocability of the eurozone is going to be guaranteed in any potential scenario.",1900-01-01 02:32:38,2015-06-18 00:00:00
luis de guindos,"and i think that this is important because… i have said that from the beginning that i do not know how we have reached this point. i am not going to blame anybody. i have my = opinion but my opinion is not that important now. but i think that, you now, we are confronting a reality and we cannot forget this reality because otherwise we are making an important mistake.",1900-01-01 02:33:25,2015-06-18 00:00:00
peter kažimír,"can i say  i do not want to torture you, but so many questions should be raised. exactly how many days should we wait for the completion? how many days? just one week or the 29th june or 30th june? you know that all we know is that we have national procedures for any changes, especially wolfgang with the bundestag and with other parliaments.",1900-01-01 02:33:53,2015-06-18 00:00:00
jeroen dijsselbloem,"i think that we all know what the final day is, it’s when the program expires, and we all know that there are parliamentary procedures to be followed in a number of countries, but i will repeat my opinion and i think it is quite broadly shared that it would not be right to take a decision here today on whether we have come to an end of the process because we have not, that is my assessment.",1900-01-01 02:35:17,2015-06-18 00:00:00
jeroen dijsselbloem,"and with you, i am frankly worried about the time that remains, and that the, about the opportunities that still remain. i don’t think it would be wise for us to now to take a decision on whether we have come to the end of the process, we’ve not. but we have to make it absolutely clear that on the basis of the old mou and the agreement of 20th_february there is still a real opportunity to reach a new agreement. it will have to be on that basis and it will have to be agreed with the institutions first. that is also is my response to yanis’ remark that we did not react to his new proposal.",1900-01-01 02:35:50,2015-06-18 00:00:00
jeroen dijsselbloem,"i did react to it by saying it must be discussed by the institutions first. he may not agree with that procedure, but this is how we work, it’s the only way we can work. we cannot assess new proposals being brought into the meeting like this. they have to be assessed and discussed with the institutions first. my assessment that there is still a window of opportunity and it is certainly in the interest of the greek people to try and grasp that opportunity and we stand ready even though time is very very short  to see whether that opportunity can be used and will be used.",1900-01-01 02:36:10,2015-06-18 00:00:00

christine lagarde,thank you very much.,1900-01-01 00:03:17,2015-06-22 00:00:00
christine lagarde,"um. i think this document that we have received is actually both um strategic and smart. it’s strategic because it was released, certainly to us at uh half past midnight in version one, at eight am in version two, and ten am in version three. so i don’t know whether version four is coming or whether we’ll have something else to expect but  it’s very strategic. and it’s coming so late, which sadly the way because we could have made much more progress had we had the opportunity and the time to just go through the general proposal.",1900-01-01 00:03:25,2015-06-22 00:00:00
christine lagarde,"it is smart in the way that it seems to use the framework of what we have called repeatedly the aide memoire, which as you will remember is this document which cannot be really shared without issue with some parliament but which is in and of itself uh a diluted version from the aide memoire so this strategic and smart document is moving in that direction, of the aide memoire but is certainly not the aide memoire as it is. neither from the fiscal standpoint, which is also very smartly addressed, nor in the content, nor in the structural reforms, nor in the smart omissions that  here and there put in the document.",1900-01-01 00:04:03,2015-06-22 00:00:00
christine lagarde,"so having been negative, as is quite often expected from the imf, but honest to what i have had about twenty minutes to go through, i think that they are positive moves in quite a few directions but it lacks specificity, it’s only semi comprehensive, and we need to actually sit down and do some real technical work in order to assess what will be unleashed by the various proposals. we cannot say because there is point zero x of vat or point zero y of vat or because there will be additional contributions to finance the pensions system as is proposed in some instances, it’s going to bridge the gap.",1900-01-01 00:04:50,2015-06-22 00:00:00
christine lagarde,"what i’d do a simple, stupid exercise of comparing what we had in the aide memoire which was one percentage gdp out of pension reform, one percentage of gdp out of vat reform, and half a percentage of gdp out of subsidies reform. it doesn’t add up for the moment but i don’t want to prejudge because we have not had time to actually do the work that needs to be done.",1900-01-01 00:05:39,2015-06-22 00:00:00
christine lagarde,"the only comment that i would make on the substance is that we find it quite growth unfriendly, which is exactly the opposite direction of what we like to take going forward to make it more growth friendly. is it going to be 100% growth friendly? probably not, difficult in the present circumstances but it doesn’t have to be very growth unfriendly in that it focuses on additional contributions on labor where the labor costs edge is already… which is already quite high and i adds to the corporate tax, which as we know is historically difficult to collect, in many countries but in greece in particular.",1900-01-01 00:06:04,2015-06-22 00:00:00
christine lagarde,"on the structural reforms, uh we are i think a bit short on many points but as i said, don’t want to go into the details of it unless we have the time to do the work and the three institutions can come to a fully… a very common view which is what we, um, intent to work towards. in terms of process, i’m very much looking forward to the teams sitting down, very promptly this afternoon in order to assess and measure the contributions of the proposals, identify the gaps, and see how it can be bridged. i think that needs to be done promptly. i’m not too sure that the next two day will be sufficient but i’m certain that it will not be sufficient to reach, what under imf jargon we call a staff level agreement, which requires that there be a list of prior action, financing for the next 12 months, assurance of financing going forward, and a debt sustainability analysis which will be a factor of the current debt and possibly debt reparation.",1900-01-01 00:06:42,2015-06-22 00:00:00
christine lagarde,"having said that, i’m sure that alternative sequences can be envisaged and from our perspective we are very keen to sit down from 3 pm onwards and to hope that there is broad support in athens for what is clearly a change of approach by the authorities.",1900-01-01 00:07:45,2015-06-22 00:00:00
jeroen dijsselbloem,"thank you very much. um, yanis, we started without you sorry. i wasn’t sure if you were very close or still very far. someone asked how long it would take you to come by motorbike from athens but luckily you were quite close. uh so you’ve only missed a short part of the introduction by the commission um the three institutions have given a very first overview of your new proposal but of course i would like you to introduce them uh more uh and then well, we’ll see where we stand.",1900-01-01 00:08:05,2015-06-22 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"thank you very much, jeroen. uh thank you to the institutions. let me get one thing completely straight in the response to christine’s uh, comment about uh the smartness of strategic element in the way and the timing of the presentation. christine, let me assure you that there was no strategic delay involved, the reason why you got it late was because we were working very, very hard.",1900-01-01 00:08:42,2015-06-22 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"colleagues, you have to understand that the kind of compromises that we have affected, that we have introduced to this… in this text are politically extremely difficult. it’s not simply a question of three or four of us sitting around a table and deciding them, uh the reason why there was uh a second version during the night, i was not aware there was a third, but i don’t believe there was a third, there was a second version during the night was because, uh, there was some technical details that had to be corrected. there was no, uh, political change in the middle of the night. christine, uh you, you you you described the approach that we have taken as ‘smart’ and i suspect what you mean, uh and i think i’m faithful to the spirit in which you said it, is that we we we are trying to fudge, we are trying to stay within the institutions expectations of us but at the same time not to. this is how i understand, uh your, your uh, your point.",1900-01-01 00:09:11,2015-06-22 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"colleagues let me remind you that our guiding principal, and i think we all agree on that is the 20th_february agreement. and let me remind you that it took three eurogroups to reach that agreement, and the whole point of that agreement, especially if you read the text of 20th_february, was to establish common ground between the existing mou, the existing program, and the new ideas this government was elected to pursue.",1900-01-01 00:10:13,2015-06-22 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"this is precisely what we are doing now. so i believe that the approach we have taken is fully in the spirit of the 20th_february agreement. we’re trying to find the common ground between a program which um in the um opinion of many, including some within the imf i believe, has failed to achieve its targets, the targets that were set in 2012, uh there were various uh how shall i say? um, failures, predicted failures that were involved in that program. there were clearly huge failures on the greek side, in terms of implementation, in terms of achieving the growth targets that were set, and at the same time we need to stay within the framework but at the same- but bring up to the new set of circumstances and put together a reform package that we can push through the greek parliament, push through your parliaments, through your governments, and make a success of it.",1900-01-01 00:10:39,2015-06-22 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"so it is quite clear, and i welcome the view of the uh, other institutions as well as christine’s, that this is a framework for reaching an agreement, for founding an agreement on, within it. uh as you can see, we have made great strides at, uh, um, meeting the institutions all the way, in terms of the fiscal targets. in particular the primary surplus numbers of 1%, 2%, 3% and thereafter 3.5%. we have um put forward parametric measures, more than what was asked by the institutions. the institutions were asking for two and a half percent, we have over parametric measures of 2.8% by 2016. the difference here is that the vat target that the institutions presented to us of 1%, we do not believe we can extract it parametrically without any improvements in collectibility. we believe that, on the basis of a pretty thorough uh meso-economic, partly micro-economic, partly macro-economic analysis, that the best we can do parametrically is about 0.75% uh of gdp through parametric measures.",1900-01-01 00:11:45,2015-06-22 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"now, there seems to me that there is a small incongruity here on the part of the institutions, in particular of the imf, the argument that was being put to us as to why we need to simplify the vat code, um, was that it increases collectibility. but when we agreed on that and we proposed a major simplification of the vat code, we were asked to produce numbers parametrically, assuming that there is no improvement in collectibility. i just want to mention that as an indication of the, of the differences that still exist. but on the question of pensions, we have produced numbers that credibly promise more than 1%, just slightly, just above 1% of gdp in savings for the pension system. we propose to do it differently, instead of cutting pensions, we are proposing an increase in contributions by both uh, uh i’ll come to this in a minute. on top of that, we have undertaken significant defense cuts, cuts in defenses expenditure. and of course, other administrative measures which are very important, firstly because one of the great problems in greece, as everybody knows, is the collection of tax is not so much tax rates and parametric values.",1900-01-01 00:12:59,2015-06-22 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"on the question of uh, the growth friendliness that christine mentioned, now this is of course the crucial key. it is a key that will unlock success for this program and for the future arrangements for the greek economy. the point we wish to make is that we have accepted the fiscal numbers of the institutions fully cognizant of the fact that these numbers are recessionary, when in an economy like the one we have now, which is in recession, has never managed to get out of recession, even in 2014, at least in nominal terms. when you introduce 2.8% of measures this is by definition, not particularly growth friendly. we had to compute to estimate our different multipliers. so for instance, whether it is growth friendly or not, or relatively growth friendly compared to the institutions suggestions depends on whether you think, for instance, that reducing the lowest of the low of pensions has a smaller or larger multiplier effect comparing- compared to increasing corporate tax. but this is, this is an empirical matter and, and we can sit down of course with our technical teams and discuss this, uh this afternoon, until we’re each in agreement.",1900-01-01 00:14:19,2015-06-22 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"more precisely on the pensions, because the pensions are very important, i think for all institutions, all three institutions, and for us. um, we have determined and committed to introduce legislation immediately that dras… drastically limits early retirements beginning 1st of january. this coming january 2016. uh to push the minimum age of retirement, effective retirement not formal retirement, at 67 by the year 2025. from this year, we’re proposing that anyone who goes on early retirement, using the provisions of existing law which cannot just be cut off from one day to the next, uh there will be a 10% surcharge effectively reduction their pension in the form of a contribution to their own pension fund. that’s on top of the existing 6% so there will be a 16% reduction in the, um, pension that will be receiving… in the take home pension in a sense. the solidarity acas tranche that pierre mentioned before uh, we’ve agreed to begin replacing it in 2018, and to faze it out completely by 2020. by, within an appropriate framework compensating pensioners below the official poverty line.",1900-01-01 00:15:44,2015-06-22 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"uh at the same time, again in the context of pension reform and, and, and reaching that level of just above 1% of measures benefiting the pension system and its sustainability, we are proposing to increase the health contribution of those on supplementary benefits by 5% from 0%, which is now to 5%. to increase the social security contribution for those who are um not already enjoying a supplementary pension but who are working towards it, to increase it by half a percent of their salary, to harmonize contributions in the private… in the public sector and make them equivalent to those in the private sector that is a significant improvement in the finances of the pension funds, and of course to complete the consolidation of pension funds with an effective and important saving in the operating costs of pension funds by the 31st of september 2016.",1900-01-01 00:17:08,2015-06-22 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"now additionally we have other parametric measures uh that we are proposing as part of this document that was uh related to the institutions overnight, uh for instance i mentioned the defense cuts. we’re talking about immediate defense cuts of 200 million, uh, reforming the income tax code that involves capital taxation investment vehicles, farmers, and the self employed. um the corporate tax increase from 26% to 29%, a permanent tax regime for advertisements in the media, in particular television that have been scandalously exempt from taxation so far. um, an increased… a permanent increase in luxury tax on recreational vessels, uh taxation on vlt machines and gaming machines of 30% that was, that was an unregulated part of the market and therefore untaxed.",1900-01-01 00:18:09,2015-06-22 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"uh reforms in pharmaceutical rebates, uh, perhaps far more importantly in the long term. and this is something i’ve mentioned before here but i’d like to mention once again because it is a momentous change in greece, and it is one that i would like you to… i would like to impress upon you how difficult it was to push through parliament or to imagine pushing it through parliament, we haven’t pushed it yet but we shall. that is the creation of a fully independent tax and customs authority, outside the ministry of finance along the lines of something like the irs in the united states. uh the fiscal council that will be monitoring the budget, an independent fiscal coun… uh, uh council with a possibility, as i mentioned in our last meeting, of trading off policy space of the greek government with an automated uh deficit break.",1900-01-01 00:19:06,2015-06-22 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"regarding product market and administrative reforms that christine mentioned, we have begun and announced formally a joint project with the oecd that will be, um, that is already being implemented and which spell out to the institutions in some detail. just mention, let me mention the headlines here uh “an anti-corruption drive through-out the greek bureaucracy and the greek procurement mechanisms”, “liberalization of the construction sector” which is an important sector country like this, especially as we are exiting the recession. “the liberalization of the wholesale trade of electronic platforms” media as well as communications. removing the red tape drastically from the licensing of businesses and introducing digitalized ‘one stop shops’. uh pension system reform that is serious long term actuarial studies in conjunction with the oecd for the purposes of dealing with the problem of the system and ability of the pension system once and for all and not just through parametric measures. uh, in conjunction with the oecd and the ilo, the design flexible collective bargaining agreement for the labor markets.",1900-01-01 00:20:00,2015-06-22 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"in the realm of privatization, we have set out what is a realistic problem. let me remind you, colleagues, that the last programs of privatization in greece were scandalously um misjudged and ill designed. remember the 50 billions that were supposedly to be collected through privatization when 1/50th was achieved in the end. we have set out a very realistic program for this year 1.4 billion, for 2016 3.7 billion, and for 2017 1.2 billion in a market where asset prices have collapsed.",1900-01-01 00:21:17,2015-06-22 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"and let me now complete by saying that, colleagues, these of course are critical moments, there is very little time left, and we all have to move. we believe that our government has moved a long way towards a position of the institutions, we have accepted fiscal measures that in an economy which has uh not stopped shrinking with uh no functioning banking system in terms of credit provision with very little investment. in that kind of economy, we have accepted in order to bring about this agreement uh measures that are indeed recessionary. even under fairly conservative estimates of fiscal multipliers, we’re going to have a significant reduction in aggregate demand.",1900-01-01 00:21:56,2015-06-22 00:00:00

yanis varoufakis,"this is why we’re very much in favor of completing the review now, completing the second program, uh, and establishing the measures that we are going to agree upon and which we are going to push through parliament as the common conditionality with uh an ease and facility that will allow uh for the transfer… the effective transfer of the 27 billion of the legacy debt from the snp program into a more manageable debt repayment program so that we can have, on the one hand, our government accepting mou, a revised mou, with significant recessionary measures in it but also a flattening out, a smoothening out of the debt repayments to the snp bonds for the next year, year and a half, two years, which runs against the grain of what we are agreeing to today which is a package of reforms that makes greece sustainable again.",1900-01-01 00:24:04,2015-06-22 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"for as the minimum condition to make this work, both financially in terms of the funding gap, in terms of a modicum of hope that greece will re… will join quantitative easing uh is an snp buy back to smoothen out the short term repayment schedule and to allow a degree of hope about participating in a program, the qe program, which let’s not forget was created in order to defeat deflation, and this is significant for a country which is in the throngs of deflation, probably the only country in the eurozone today which is suffering a deflation rate of -2%. surely i believe the institutions can see that.",1900-01-01 00:25:09,2015-06-22 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"i have no doubt because i have heard this, i have discussed this with the good people of the imf that this um balancing between an mou that gives you what you need in order to seal the agreement with us and at the same time a minimum approach to the way that the debt must be managed more efficiently in order to make the mou reforms potentially successful. this balancing act is essential for us in order to be able to seal this agreement and to say that the euro group, the uh euro summit later today, the greek government, each one of you taking this… this package to your parliaments, we have signed and sealed a viable agreement for greece. one that has considerable hope and a high probability of uh ensuring that we’re not back here in a few months time, discussing the same problem again. thank you very much.",1900-01-01 00:25:53,2015-06-22 00:00:00
jeroen dijsselbloem,"thank you. um, colleagues i think that um listening to the institutions. there are two ways to look at where we are, two ways to look at the proposals. ",1900-01-01 00:27:05,2015-06-22 00:00:00
jeroen dijsselbloem,"uh was of course it’s only a first assessment because they came in only this morning, um, but i think falda said was a good start for discussion, uh, pierre told about… said it was a comprehensive package but more work needed to be done. benoit called it the right framework for discussion and had many questions on substance and, uh, specificity, christine, um, called it, after having said it was strategic and smart, she said there was some positive moves in there but also lacks specificity that doesn’t add up to  having said that i think for us the assessment of the institutions is crucial. first thing that would have to happen for us to be able to give our political judgment is to, uh, hear on that more definite assessment by the institutions and that would require still work with the greek authorities uh which would start immediately today to get the specifics, to get the details, to ask the questions that need to be asked, to understand what the proposals are, and to work on a, in the end, a very concrete, very specific list of prior actions. so we can have the first round of political remarks or values now. uh, but i think, on the basis of what we’ve heard from the institutions it’s crucial in the coming days, uh, highly concentrated work needs to be done. in order to see whether we can reach that agreement later this week. on the basis of what we have now, it is impossible to come to any final conclusions, that would be my assessment of where we are now. um, but i’ll open the floor to ministers to hear from your views and political guidance. wolfgang?",1900-01-01 00:27:14,2015-06-22 00:00:00
wolfgang schäuble,"thanks jeroen, i… i can agree with your last remark, because i didn’t see one page, one sentence, .",1900-01-01 00:29:32,2015-06-22 00:00:00
wolfgang schäuble,i can not give you any judgment of what i have been careful listening from three institutions  three institutions and not blaming one institution by others is precondition before anything else.,1900-01-01 00:29:54,2015-06-22 00:00:00

michael noonan,"thank you very much, uh jeroen. obviously there has been a move, and a move in the right direction in this  we need some space, not a lot of space, but we need at least now until thursday, so that the institutions can do a full assessment and if possible come up with a set agreement and brief us on it in great detail.",1900-01-01 00:34:56,2015-06-22 00:00:00
michael noonan,"um, at the conclusion of yanis’ remarks he referred to smp and the smoothing out of debt uh, the debt profile and the transfer of liabilities from the central bank to the esm, uh, i wouldn’t have thought that was a runner but uh, i’d like to see the central banks assessment of that and uh the views of klaus rengling on that as well.",1900-01-01 00:36:13,2015-06-22 00:00:00

michael noonan,"but, uh, taking it all in all, i hope uh we can move forward towards the solution. especially the position we were in last week, but uh it’s not a question of time running out uh, i will remind you that time has run out. we need to be direct.",1900-01-01 00:37:35,2015-06-22 00:00:00
jeroen dijsselbloem,thank you.,1900-01-01 00:37:58,2015-06-22 00:00:00
kian,"first of all, i’m very pleased there… there is some movement. um i cannot rectify much new content in this proposal. um, there is some changes in the figures  so let me point out the channel, the institutions confer, that it is non-paper, this is why there is the flexibility we decided in february in our statement in the agreement with greece. if it is in line, that’s probably the base for the discussions which are necessary in the next hour and days. but it if it’s not in line there will be much more than the flexibility that we agreed on february that must be dealt in discussion in between ministers of finance. so i don’t know exactly what is the content of this aide memoire, but the discussions about a non-paper is very difficult for us to make the right decisions.",1900-01-01 00:38:07,2015-06-22 00:00:00
jeroen dijsselbloem,there are many questions that we raised so ,1900-01-01 00:39:40,2015-06-22 00:00:00
male,"thanks jeroen. uh, i actually have a few questions to ask, rather than statements to make. the only statement i would make is  uh i have two questions. one question is to the institutions, i understand from your language and the adjectives you used in assessing state, that there are disagreements. so, uh, i wanted to go into the details of the disagreement in this room but of course as long as there is major disagreement among the institutions it’s very difficult, on the basis of that, to provide a political assessment. we must rely on a common view of the institutions, where they stand and whether there is milage to make going forward.",1900-01-01 00:39:49,2015-06-22 00:00:00
male,"so, this um, my second point which was… i mean to take up a point which uh here pierre according to my notes made, and others: the prior action story. let’s face it. we need to rebuild trust at a minimum level that allows us to move forward, and the extended prior actions are an instrument for more… more confidence. i would urge that these are put forward and met as this is directly, especially to yanis and the greek government, we value and need this or because if we don’t have it, let’s not hide ourselves, then really we’re wasting your time. thank you.",1900-01-01 00:41:00,2015-06-22 00:00:00
luis de guindos,"thank you, jeroen. first of all i am also happy that uh we have started to see some movement apparently in the right direction. i share the same view that uh, that uh, that uh, pierre [carlo with respect to how we have reached this situation. that we have started to comment and collaborate on potential uh capital controls. um, well, how much time we have lost and how is it possible that we have reached this situation that we are on the verge of collapse.",1900-01-01 00:41:52,2015-06-22 00:00:00
luis de guindos,"uh, thirdly…well, we are… i don’t know what i have to tell my boss, you know for the meeting of today. uh i can tell him that, you know, the institutions have a good impression about the recent proposal but that there is not a concrete uh uh assessment about the real situation. so, you know, immediately he is going to reply why have i been reconvened with the rest of the heads to this meeting?",1900-01-01 00:42:32,2015-06-22 00:00:00
luis de guindos,"why? and i think that this is a fair question, for, for, for everybody. and my concern is that we have generated expectations, i don’t know if you have seen the reaction of the markets today, the capital markets. but now, now, we, you know, someone is sending the signal that we are on the track. that i think that we are on the right track, a little bit late but apparently we are… we are on the right track. but uh uh uh, i think that we should be careful with creating this kind of expectations, because if there is one thing that should… everybody around this table should be aware is that markets over shoot. so the reactions today might be upset tomorrow in the other way around, and what we are keeping at the end of the day is only one thing: volatility. volatility in the market place. so it’s something that we have to take into consideration and to bear in mind.",1900-01-01 00:43:07,2015-06-22 00:00:00
luis de guindos,"and finally, as pier carlo and others, i would like to ask two questions. the first one is about debt reprofiling. we can call it, you know, semantics is very ample. but i would like to know, you know the proposals, are we thinking about any sort of restructuring of the debt? is there any proposal in that direction? and the second one, also for this  implements all the measures uh that uh you know this plan the full implementation of this plan will imply any additional funding for the greek authorities?",1900-01-01 00:44:05,2015-06-22 00:00:00

yanis varoufakis,"thank you very much jeroen. colleague we’re working through the night and during the day towards a good agreement. we have a duty to complete it quickly. today’s an important day. the euro summit is going to prove crucial in creating the mood for establishing the framework within which we are going to, be able to do the technical work, speed it up towards this goal, this collective goal.",1900-01-01 00:49:35,2015-06-22 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"i was asked by wolfgang a very straightforward question and i need to give… the duty to give a straightforward answer. you asked me, wolfgang, whether the greek government is ready and willing to impose capital controls. our view, let me make this crystal clear, is that there is no need whatsoever for capital controls as long as we are successful in bringing about this agreement. the greek public has shown immense calmness despite being bombarded both by the greek media, by the foreign media, by us politicians with a great deal of insecurity and a great deal of almost terrorizing news regarding bank closures, capital controls, and so on.",1900-01-01 00:50:06,2015-06-22 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"the moment we, the politicians, the technocrats, our leaders announce that an agreement has been stuck, there will be no need for capital controls. but beyond that, let me remind you that greece is not an island with a single airport without common borders, with the rest of the european continent, capital controls will be almost impossible to implement properly. uh, and going down that road is going to unleash forces, which i do not believe that any one of us can be confident that we can control. on the question that… another question that was asked about the midterm financing effectively: this is a very serious, uh, reform agenda, that we’re discussing, this mou that we have, uh, renegotiating and hopefully we shall conclude either today or tomorrow or maybe as michael said by wednesday or thursday.",1900-01-01 00:50:53,2015-06-22 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"um, is a very difficult package for us politically and i have no doubt that it’s a very difficult package for you to, all of us will have difficulty pushing it through a parliament.",1900-01-01 00:51:51,2015-06-22 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"it should end the crisis. it should be the last time you have to do this and we have to do this. but in order to be able to do this, we need to look at the repayment schedule, which is, this was designed, let me remind you a long, long time ago before the uh, fiscal numbers and the growth numbers were derailed after 2012 the proposal that we’re putting forward is really very simple. once we are happy with the conditionalities, once we agree on the conditionalities, once we have a time table for prior actions as uh pierre carlos said we should embed this within a framework that makes sense and gives it the air of a sound public finance, which is necessary in which not to suffocate. so the point here is very simple. let me just describe it once more but very succinctly. the idea is that we have these 27 billion sitting on the books of the ecb which are preventing us from returning to the markets.",1900-01-01 00:52:01,2015-06-22 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"market access is what we promise at the end of every agreement. without qe, greece will find it very difficult, it will be actually a cruel irony if the only country that needs it so badly is the one that is excluded from it. the only way we can do this is by without going to our parliament again in a few months time or in a year’s time.",1900-01-01 00:53:10,2015-06-22 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"and meanwhile losing this opportunity of taking ad- advantage of a program which will not last forever if we don’t jump on the bandwagon of qe, now we are going to, to, to, to miss out on this. so the proposal is this. the mou that we are negotiating should be of course the basis for completing the current review, the fifth review, and at the same time that completes the european program.",1900-01-01 00:53:30,2015-06-22 00:00:00

yanis varoufakis,"colleagues. the only reason why i’m tiring you this is because we need to answer the question, how do we make this mou that we’re describing the set of conditionalities not only politically feasible, but also how can we create a space in the midterm for public financial intervention that can make it breathe work so that this euro group is not saddled yet again in a few months time with more crunch meetings like this one.",1900-01-01 00:54:59,2015-06-22 00:00:00

edward scicluna,"why do i say friday evening? because there needs to be a deal by saturday morning, so that it can be then pushed, possibly, through the greek parliament, so that it can then be approved by our parliaments. so that would basically mean that we would have, i don’t know, four, five, even six eurogroups, within approximately eight days. now, um, i don’t know, some people mentioned, and i think, correctly, the credibility, uh, of the eurogroup, in, in, in this whole process and, and how we look. that’s one side of the story. the other side of the story is, is what mario was talking about, basically market reaction because now we’re going back and, and, and forth. so i just wanted to ask you, jeroen, how you plan to take it forward and also just some kind of a rain check from yanis, on, on whether there is an attempt to push it one more time, uh, to the summit, uh, meeting, which i, i don’t think in and of itself would be helpful. but  i think that’s what’s gonna happen.",1900-01-01 00:20:41,2015-06-24 00:00:00

jeroen dijsselbloem,"looking back, ah, last couple of weeks, uh, three institutions have worked on a common position, and after that agreed to present it for the first time, quite a comprehensive set of proposals, at nine pages. which was a positive step, as opposed to how we discussed it here. also we realized that the institutions had not been able to give a more thorough assessment of those proposals to see how close they were to the framework which we agreed. that work has been done over the last couple of days. at the same time, the greek authorities have presented a list of prior actions. not only did we, the institutions, come to the assessment that there were still a number of problems in the nine pages, to answer gutchen, these problems are along the line fiscal gaps, so the greek authorities said they could agree to the proposed, by the institutions proposed, not agreed by us yet. but by the institutions proposed new fiscal targets and timelines. the authorities have said we could agree to those. but then the methods have to add up to those. so there were fiscal gaps.",1900-01-01 00:44:08,2015-06-24 00:00:00

jeroen dijsselbloem,"that must be the case. today we have gone through these proposals. um, we have not been able to close that gap. *i’ve listened* very carefully to you today, and have reaffirmed the statement of the 20th. absolutely clear that we cannot diverge from it. you have made clear that, uh, the current situation can be no talk of debt restructuring, etcetera. uh, wolfgang added there can be no additional money. no fresh money. very clear. that’s the basis that we must work on in order to propo- to bring to you proposals that are valid. that have a chance of getting your approval. it takes a lot more time than, uh, we would like. it’s getting a lot more media coverage than is helpful. and it is putting a great strain on your agendas, ah, to which i apologize, ah, but this is where we are. now on the issue of tomorrow, i think there are two options. we can say that we adjourn temporarily this meeting and reopen it tomorrow. we can also say that only on the basis of what is there tomorrow, we will call a new meeting. but some of you would have said that you would also like to be informed, and maybe talk about different scenarios if there is no agreement.",1900-01-01 00:46:51,2015-06-24 00:00:00

yanis varoufakis,"thank you jeroen. as a everyone knows this is uh, this has been a very laborious process. it has been uh, variously um, difficult and sometimes uh, unpleasant. uh, i have to concur on this but the unpleasantness should not um, deter us from looking at what we have achieved. if you compare the two documents, the document that is in front of you by the institutions and our document, you’ll find that they are very close. i believe that especially if you take into consideration where we started from and you compare it with where we are, convergence is the only word that comes to mind. we have converged on primary balance uh, targets uh, for the near and medium term. we have uh, exactly the same fiscal baselines scenarios after quite a lot of deliberation on this. for 2015 an 2016.",1900-01-01 00:09:58,2015-06-25 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"as a result of this coincidence of primary balances and the fiscal baseline scenario uh, we have um, convergence, complete convergence on uh our estimates of fiscal gaps for 2015 and 2016. there have been a multitude of uh, agreements uh. most recently it was uh, recommended to use that we should uh, introduce a tax on shipping and ship owners in greece. something that previous governments would never have done. uh, we were grateful to the institutions for having made that suggestion. it strengthened us and we have adopted it. so this is just one example of last minute convergence.",1900-01-01 00:11:13,2015-06-25 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"uh, our government has um, only two sticking issues picking up the point that uh, pier made about the two major issues that consumed countless hours of deliberations and negotiations uh. vat reform on the one hand and pensions on the other. we have proposed uh, a major vat reform, v-a-t reform. uh, the estimated yield from that reform comes to 1.7 billion a year, or almost one percent, 0.93% of gdp. we are proposing to um, have a lower rate of six percent just for pharmaceuticals, books and theatrical performances, we have a tradition in greece of subsidizing the theatre um, a mid-level rate 13%, which is where most the food goes uh, energy, utilities i should say more generally, and uh, hotels which as you can imagine in greece are a very important part of the economy. and then to um, to, to, to, to 23% which is a top rate, we put everything else.",1900-01-01 00:12:00,2015-06-25 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"it took a long time for uh, our technical teams to devise a model that we could use as a common model by which to estimate the impact of different tax rates upon um, our uh, v-a-t take, and this is uh, i consider this to be a successful endeavor on the part of the institutions and us of establishing this common ground uh, in at least in terms of the analysis. uh, the institutions requested um, that we should get a little bit more than 0.93, t-t- they requested one percent of gdp in extra vat. we are very close to this. the point i want to make regarding vat, and i think that this is a point that collogues will take well, it is meant well, is that one of the great problems we have in greece is um, collectability. our collectability rates are very low. we’ve had a very uh, bad track record on this and this is where we would want, and this is where we want an amat focusing our efforts in order to increase our vat take. as you all know, when you’re attempting to increase collectability, increase in tax rates and pushing whole categories of goods and services onto the higher tax rate, is not helpful. so there is question here of whether the emphasis of reform should be on changing the tax rate, harmonizing the tax rate or actually on the tax collection system itself.",1900-01-01 00:13:21,2015-06-25 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"we believe that it is the latter which will bring in much greater revenues than those estimated but we did not agree with institutions on how to compute, to calculate, to estimate the improvements the different reforms in the tax administration system would have. um, on the pension system. the institutions demanded uh, a one percent of gdp improvement in the fiscal impact of our pensions system. we have delivered that. we have delivered it in a way which differs from that was, that which was proposed by the institutions, so we are increasing contributions to the pensions’ system together with the drastic elimination of early retirements. the institutions would prefer reductions in the actual pensions rather than increases in contribution. uh, we are also proposing that is quite significant uh, to our gov- to our gover- to our parliament, we are ready to propose to our parliament uh, that the institutions’ uh, suggestion, that we harmonize contributions between the different funds, in particular between the private sector and the public sector funds, goes ahead at the cost of public sector employees who will have to increase their contributions.",1900-01-01 00:15:10,2015-06-25 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"um, product markets, some product markets, product market reforms, we have agreed upon. others, we have maintain differences. let me say collogues at this stage i don’t intend to speak for very long jeroen, but i do think it is important to mention that this government has shifted a great deal. on almost every front we’ve crossed what we considered originally to be our red lines. what we are asking for, as you can see or hear from what i just said, was a degree of policy space. christine referred to maximum flexibility, we don’t see that the institutions have applied maximum flexibility. we have applied a lot more flexibility, we’ve bent over backwards effectively in order to come closer or very close to institutions’ position. i believe that uh, in, both in the case of ireland and the case of portugal, the institutions showed a great deal more flexibility than um, in what we have experienced over the last few days. and let me just finish by focusing on perhaps the most significant aspect of our disagreement, of the reason why we have not achieved complete convergence yet.",1900-01-01 00:16:34,2015-06-25 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"the list of prior actions that we are presenting to you, in the document that you have in front of you, is a very difficult set of reforms for us. it would be very hard for us politically in an economy which is experiencing seven years of unending non-stop contraction of nominal gdp, to introduce measure of two and a half percent of gdp and parametric ones on top of that other non-parametric ones. there is no doubt that especially in view of the dysfunctionality of our banking system as they are over-laden by npls. that these prior actions are certainly going to be recessionary. we tried to make them redistributive in a way that is closer to our program. our program did not envisage such recessionary measures but accepted them. we accepted them to the full magnitude that was request of us. but we have slanted them in a manner which is redistributed, re- redistributive um, in, uh, harmony with uh, our political priorities. we are prepared to take such an sla, such a set of prior actions through parliament and do it efficiently and quickly. but we are going to face a great deal of discontent, not only from our own government members of parliament but throughout the parliament house.",1900-01-01 00:18:03,2015-06-25 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"and the question that we will be asked as ministers in parliament is: you want to ask to pass these prior actions, these are difficult ones for an economy in recession. what are you offering us? do you envisage that as part of this agreement there is clear sight of an escape from the debt deflationary cycle. that, that we can say that greece in the next few months can look forward to coming out of the woods, so to speak, of the crisis. the problem, collogues, is that as you, many of you said yesterday in this very room, that this is a set of prior actions that is the foundation for an extension of the program by a few months. let’s say until the end of the year. which of course means in the mind of any rational investor that they will think, okay, so another set of negotiations is going to be come to, to, to, to kick in, in november, another set of headlines full of uncertainty and full of concerns about grexit and about this and that.",1900-01-01 00:19:37,2015-06-25 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"i submitted to you colleagues that this kind of extension is simply going to, after a few days of buoyancy in the markets, as a result of having come to an agreement. very, very soon after that, investors are going to be in suspended animation, they’re going to be waiting to see what happens towards the end of the extension. an economy which is already in a recession and introduces these heavily recessionary measures. because let’s face it: two and a half percent, what, however redistributed within the greek social economy, they are going to be recessionary. without having a clear view ahead, with these bumpidy payments of the smp bonds as they are approaching, without any, um, serious discussion of our proposal, which involves absolutely no new money for greece. many colleagues mentioned here no new money for greece. we did not suggest new money for greece. we suggested an operation involving the esm, which is perfectly legal which we could agree to it now uh, in such a way as to smoothen out the repayment schedule, the bumpy lumpy smp repayments over the next year or two, which is the time during which this economy has to achieve escape velocity, so that you and i do not come back here at the end of december with another set of conditionalities, another round of negotiations, another set of meetings perhaps to go again to our parliaments, again to face political pressure both in greece and in your own polity.",1900-01-01 00:20:53,2015-06-25 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"our hope was that we would be able to agree on prior actions that would be hard for us but which unleash us from the shackles of this never ending cycle of debt deflation. but even at this late, late stage i’m conveying to you our government’s determination to reach the common ground which we set out to reach on the 20th_february, as per the communique. i believe that any impartial spectator or observer looking at the documents will come to the safe conclusion that we don’t have the right as a eurogroup not to reach an agreement today, thank you.",1900-01-01 00:22:37,2015-06-25 00:00:00

alexander stubb,"one is option a which is some kind of flexibility on conditionality uh, perhaps some kind of discussion of a way out from this dilemma. that will probably weaken the credibility of the euro. the other one is a plan b. an exit of one of the members of the eurozone now in the short term immediate term that would probably cause a lot of political and market turbulence. a lot of turbulence in the european project in general, but some say perhaps in the long term it would actually strengthen our common currency. now i, i really don’t know how we’re gonna get out of, of this one but all i’m trying to say is that the longer we prolong this, to take it to the 11th hour on the 30th of june, the worse of i think all of us are. now on the specifics, and i say this as a very strong pro-european much like wolgang. wolfgang looked at seven differences in changes from the memorandum of understanding. and i have a tendency to agree with those, i’d probably a notch a tiny little notch softer but saying that i simply don’t have a mandate to make a move. especially on the financing side uh, on the repayments from the efsf that’s just one example and i think  etcetera, etcetera.",1900-01-01 00:42:51,2015-06-25 00:00:00
alexander stubb,"uh, sometimes the debate seems to be a little one sided but i agree with all of those including hans and luis who said you know we have to sell this at home. uh, and, and, and what is on the table now  institutions might be very difficult to sell it at home and that’s why i come to my questions or point is how, how do we take this forward from here? because i think it would benefit all of us to, to, to end this as soon as possible. and, and how do you jeroen..and i, i really don’t envy you in this task, how do you see these next hours panning out because we’re seriously, seriously running out of time and we are seriously making um, i think, yeah. we, we the problem is we’re not increasing credibility of the euro nor our eurogroup as such. and by the way i’ll come back to what i said yesterday.",1900-01-01 00:44:35,2015-06-25 00:00:00

michael noonan,"second point id like to make is that uh i don’t that the uh, sustainability analysis paper adds up. uh, there’s a phrase in it about a three year program financed with concessional financing. i have no idea what that means, no idea what that means. and uh, i’d like to see uh documents specify but my first advice um, staff is that the debt sustainability document needs more work. i personally believe it’s flawed and doesn’t for me add up and there are concepts included in it that i’m not quite clear on.  and there’s one common factor always before agreement is reached and that is the two sides have to trust each other. now i think there is very limited trust at the table and uh, i think that there’s responsibility on leading negotiations to see that they build on trust because without trust this will not be resolved and uh, we’ll find ourselves on monday or tuesday reacting to events rather than controlling events. and i think we should keep controlling of events.",1900-01-01 00:47:45,2015-06-25 00:00:00
michael noonan,"final point is uh, i think there’s such a divergence in detail. and that as a eurogroup we can’t be expected to get involved in the negotiating process. in previous occasions if it’s down to two or three net points that are sticking points, the eurogroup can come up with the appropriate compromises. but when it’s such a wide agenda  how does he see this playing out? um, um on the limited timeline that is all available to us? so thank you jeroen, i appreciate how difficult your position is for as far as i’m concerned you’re doing everything possible to resolve the situation.",1900-01-01 00:49:25,2015-06-25 00:00:00

christine lagarde,"i would uh, like to uh, to, to address the last point that as made uh, concerning the situation. what has changed? how can we move from where we were six months ago when there was, written of course ,some primary surplus, and where we are today. i think it boils down to two key targets that have been missed for reasons that we can analyze but the first one is primary surplus which has been much lower than what was expected and i think there has been significant slippages in terms of revenue collections in particular over the last, not just the last six months but over the last 12 months, let’s face it. the whole period of the election was also not good from the revenue collections point of view as is often the case in an election period. since that, it has worsened and uh the primary surplus that was expected out of the operations of uh, the greek government and the greek administrations um, has not delivered what was expected. the general climate of uncertainty caused by, where are we, where is it going, what is the situation, what is the position has certainly not helped in that process.",1900-01-01 01:03:58,2015-06-25 00:00:00
christine lagarde,"i think the second key shortfall which explains also why there has been so much slippage is the privatization. uh there was a much higher number that was expected out of privatization i think it’s a constant of the greek programs for the last five years or so but it certainly has not improved. and what we uh, we are perceiving is certainly uh, a concern by the bidders or by those that would be interested potentially in  situation to actually worsen as a result.",1900-01-01 01:05:17,2015-06-25 00:00:00
christine lagarde,"the point about the uh, the flexibility which uh, many of you have mentioned is, is correct uh. we have actually collected between the three institutions, we have demonstrated a lot of flexibility not just for the targets on which we have agreement with the uh, the greek authorities, 1, 2, 3.5%  those targets eventually been moved but in terms of the content what will deliver uh , that uh, that, that uh, those consolidation measures and the ultimate result of surplus. we are not, first of all, let’s put it that way we are not in agreement yet. or maybe we will never be in agreement, i don’t know, i hope it’s a yet rather than never, uh, with the greek authorities. we, i think, all have a particular concern which we have expressed which is that many of those measures are following suite to the old methods that have been applied by the greek authorities. which consist of taxing, taxing and retaxing.",1900-01-01 01:06:10,2015-06-25 00:00:00
speaker 19,"uh, we certainly would have all preferred that it be less growth and friendly and that there be more in terms of uh, cutting spending than there is on tax revenue generated. tax as a revenue generating uh, principle. you will see if and when you have time to go though uh, the proposals actually both documents. we think that it’s not particularly growth friendly. be it as it may it’s even more growth unfriendly in the greek proposals. now, why we have not come up with a compare which is you know what uh, lawyers in the room would be used to when you have one document and the other document is because there has been a very um, long standing impossibility for whatever reasons on the part of the greek party at the table to actually work on the basis of the document. eventually we came to working on the similar mattress of the document but the last document was put to us at 11:15 earlier today. so as hard as our teams worked and i can assure that they worked the night through. two nights ago, last night, again, but it was just materially impractically impossible to produce that compare between the two versions.",1900-01-01 01:07:13,2015-06-25 00:00:00

yanis varoufakis,"yes thank you jeroen. let me begin by saying to my slovenian colleague that uh, and also to others who let it um, sort of created an impression with their intervention that the program was on track until we were elected. colleagues the reason why we were elected was because the program was off the rails. the only reason. the uh, view that i heard that there was some growth last year is one that i would like very seriously to contest. nominal gdp never stopped falling. i’ve told you this a number of times. i’m saying this to you again. we never had growth in 2014. indeed every single target was missed, especially the primary number for 2014. but let’s not look backwards we have a very serious problem here in our hands uh, christine mentioned that uh, the privatization agenda has not produced the goods, well it didn’t produce the goods in an economy where asset price has collapsed. and therefore it was impossible to reach those completely unfathomable targets.",1900-01-01 01:09:01,2015-06-25 00:00:00

yanis varoufakis,"regarding our measures that have been um, repeatedly described as not particularly growth friendly, i have to repeat the point i made before that when you have these large measures, uh, they’re not going to be growth friendly. and i made the point yesterday, i have to make it again, that whether you, it, it’s more growth friendly to reduce very low pensions will have a very high fiscal multiplayer or to increase corporate taxes is an empirical matter. i don’t have the numbers here for, yeah i don’t think that anybody does. uh, it’s only through trial and error that you will work this one out. um, the point that uh, pier carlo made was very important. because if he’s right, than i’m very happy. if i correctly understand pier carlo, you said that you disagreed with me that if we have an extension for six months or so uh, eight months, nine months, whatever, than without a new um, approach to our debt repayment schedule, without any creative public finance, my prognostication was that in a few months time we will be back to where we are now, because the animal spirits will not come back on, because there will be no growth spurt because there will, because all investors, rational investors will be thinking ahead to the next negotiation. waiting for what happens at the end of it.",1900-01-01 01:11:02,2015-06-25 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"pier carlo disagreed, he thought that this is not necessarily so. i hope you are right, but i noticed colleagues that at least five of those who spoke, expressed either um, an inability to push through their parliament and through there polity the institutions’ own proposals. or they said that the, the proposals that are on the table, whether its ours or the institutions’, do not offer a viable solution. now, this is a very serious political problem, and it speaks to what michel was saying before. that we have a political duty to come up with an outcome which is sustainable. and i do believe that this is always something that the eurogroup wants to do and wants to include at the end of every statement, every communique.",1900-01-01 01:12:32,2015-06-25 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"that the country, the program country that we are discussing is going to, will have insight market access. this was the point we were raising. the reason why we are um, at, at, uh, um, we haven’t agreed yet is because firstly, we ask for more flexibility, not in terms of the fiscal numbers but in terms of measures within those fiscal numbers, and secondly because we can’t see how this very large package can be pushed through all our parliaments. when there is no prospect for more than a few months of an extension. so i come to the conclusion, to the conclusion, to the question that alexander amongst others asked, so what do we want to do from now on? what do we foresee as the next few steps.",1900-01-01 01:13:28,2015-06-25 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"let me, let me, let me say that we are very much like you at a loss. we hope that there are steps we can all take. we are constrained like you by our own parliaments, i cannot go to my parliament and table prior actions like you can’t, like you can’t wolfgang. we cannot push through our parliaments a set of prior actions without being able to answer the question: is this sustainable? my great concern, as a european, not as a greek at this very moment, is that, and again i’m alluding to something alexander said about the kind of governance that we have, that this is a major concern for the way we are running europe. the way we are running our monetary union. we should not be in position where we throw up our hands up in the air, and we declare that we don’t know how to move ahead. we all have the same interests, we all have a common purpose to bring this to fruition, we should find a way of doing it.",1900-01-01 01:14:17,2015-06-25 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"i was hoping that today we would be able to come to this agreement. alexander, i genuinely didn’t want this to go to the summit tonight or to any other forum. let us just resolve to make an example out of ourselves so that we can find a way of taking to our parliaments and set of prior actions that will go through the greek parliament that is sustainable and which you can sell to our own people not just to our members of parliament, honestly and in faith within ourselves that it is truly sustainable. thank you.",1900-01-01 01:15:23,2015-06-25 00:00:00
jeroen dijsselbloem,"thank you. um, before giving the floor to the rest  for returning mario would like to say something.",1900-01-01 01:16:05,2015-06-25 00:00:00
mario draghi,"yeah, j-just one word um, marcus was sitting and waiting here waiting for the opportunity . and then, and the i don’t know, thank you.",1900-01-01 01:16:17,2015-06-25 00:00:00
jeroen dijsselbloem,"right colleague, thank you all very much for your reactions and your guidance. think, listen carefully to what you are saying. on the one hand i think the institutions have put forward proposals that they think uh, are final and credible. which could be the basis for an agreement. a number of you have questions whether these proposals are  tough enough to put it quite bluntly. uh, uh, that can be debated. on the other hand there are new greek proposals on some of the prior actions which came in late and therefore i could not hold up sending you the documents. um, but we recognize some of these proposals that will take us even further from a credible and tough and fiscally sound uh, package. so if you say you must go back and look at these proposals uh, i will ask the institutions if they are prepared to do so. to go through those proposals again. but uh listening to you there is no scope uh, to deviate even more from the mou, because already you are, some of you are quite critical of the sorry, the aide memoire and papers by the institution because some of you are already quite critical on whether they are good enough.",1900-01-01 01:17:31,2015-06-25 00:00:00
jeroen dijsselbloem,"second point would be that uh, uh, there are also issues of course about debt sustainability, future financing need, the question of a third program. uh, the way to look at that i think is and has very much to do with trust. to take it step by step, no way can i ask from you or can you ask from parliaments, your parliaments to now agree to future support uh, to greece. given the backlash in the program of the last year basically certainly in last half year, the backtracking. so um, i think we should have to take it to rebuild that trust, take it step by step, so we’d be focusing very much on how can we build the package now to come to a successful completion of the current program. practically speaking that would also mean another extension to get it done to disperse etcetera. the extension can only be limited given the amount of money still available to the current program.",1900-01-01 01:19:00,2015-06-25 00:00:00
jeroen dijsselbloem,"on that basis and if that approach is successful, is successful in the coming months, because the program gets back on track and in the end will lead to a positive uh final review, we could in the fall return to the question, how do we move forward? uh, and i would not like to exclude that if the program is back on track and greece  that is the thing, the way i think we could approach this issue. but of course we can only come to that debate if there is an agreement on how to finalize this problem, we’ve always said this, first we need an agreement on what needs to be done and it needs to be implemented successful final review and then we are in a new phase in which hopefully trust has also returned a little and we can talk about the future. debt sustainability further financial support where needed etcetera, it is to early now. so that will be my sequencing.",1900-01-01 01:20:10,2015-06-25 00:00:00
jeroen dijsselbloem,"anyway returning to where we are now, we need an agreement and many of you are still underlined stressed the importance of an agreement, we need an agreement on how to fix the current program, in a credible way. um, so what i think we should do is ask the institutions if they are prepared to work with the greeks on new proposals, but they would have to stay in current lines, and not deviate further. i think this is .",1900-01-01 01:21:30,2015-06-25 00:00:00

yanis varoufakis,"we’re all in this room hoping for an agreement as i said, but we all have constraints in terms of our mandates. all colleagues do. we do not have a mandate, to um, accept the backtracking that we not is from the institutions. for instance, for days now the institutions have been um, pressurizing us to accept that, this is just an example, that catering in restaurants should go up from 13% to 23% of a um, v-a-t range, and when we, in ,in, in the spirit of cooperation, we said yes last night uh, we were told that this would not yield the improvement in revenues that the, the model we had commonly worked on and we’d agreed would be the common basis, delivered. so we see a lot of backtracking in true from the side of the institutions. let me give you another example, we are a country that is relaying so heavily on tourism-",1900-01-01 01:24:11,2015-06-25 00:00:00

yanis varoufakis,"…we eh, well i’m going to give you an example of a inflexibility that our colleagues should know. we, you all know the extent to which we rely on tourism. there is a demand by the institutions that we take hotels to 23% of v-a-t, when on the opposite coast, a mile, a nautical mile away in turkey it’s seven percent. now i do not have the mandate to simply say that for the purposes of a-a-achieving an agreement now i will sign up to this dotted line. this is another example of inflexibility. there is a great deal of this. this is how the greek side sees it and i think that you should know it. maybe we are wrong, maybe the institutions are right, or vice-versa. on the question of what, how do we take it from here just like pier, just like christine, just like mario, of course we are willing and ready to continue work but when jeroen you say that we have to work within the lines i, i need to ask you to tell me exactly what this means. that this means either we accept the document of the institutions or else? is it what one of the colleagues said that it’s a take it or leave it. because i just need to convey this to my government.",1900-01-01 01:25:28,2015-06-25 00:00:00
jeroen dijsselbloem,"i asked the institutions the questions would they be willing and prepared to work further with you? we don’t do the negotiations in eurogroup. i don’t do the negotiations, they have been trying to reach an agreement with you. colleagues here have said on the basis of what the institutions have so far together put on the table this is already maybe too much, already deviating from where we set out in the framework of 20th_february. nonetheless, the commission, the ecb have said, and, and christine in principle, have said of course willing to agree, uh, christine has raised the question, how are we going to get there if you just keep putting in new proposals that’s take away fiscal space that’s uh, take away the urgency from structural reforms, that uh, shift balance even more towards taxes and less to revenue cuts. that is the problem, that’s the circle we’ve been going through now for a long time. so once again uh, what, how much room do you see to reach an agreement? because, that’s basically the question.",1900-01-01 01:26:39,2015-06-25 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"well i think that the only remedy for this agreement is further conversation, i know no other remedy. on the questions that you raised, i think that they are up for uh, further deliberation. we don’t believe that we are asking for fiscal space, we have agreed on the fiscal numbers. our proposals about reform simply are different to the institutions. we believe that our reforms are uh, more efficient reforms, we maybe wrong but it’s not a question that we do not want to reform so we are going to do backtracking on reforms. we don’t believe that simply cutting pensions is a reform, it’s a cutback. maybe we should have it but it, we do not think that this is going to solve the problem of reforming the pension system. but as i said, discussions. further work.",1900-01-01 01:28:01,2015-06-25 00:00:00

alexander stubb,"and may i, yanis, put forward a proposal. for wolfgang, i am taking an extreme. the aide memoire and the document of the institutions go too far. for you it doesn’t go far enough. the imf and others have asked you to make sure that you can push it through. my suggestion would be that you take the aide memoire and a strong set of prior actions to your parliament this weekend. if it passes we will continue to negotiate, if it doesn’t pass that’s the end of the road. because we have a mandate for the memorandum of understanding but we need to be sure that you’ll be able to push it through a aide- memoire. and right now i sense in eurogroup that this is simply ain’t gonna happen. so we need to be sure because otherwise it’s going to be impossible for us to take aide memoire in to the parliaments. so, i would fall into the category of saying, at least from my perspective, we are pretty much in a take it or leave it situation, but you need to tee it up with your parliament first. sorry for that this is perhaps rookie bluntness, but that’s how i see it.",1900-01-01 01:40:07,2015-06-25 00:00:00
jeroen dijsselbloem,"let me make a couple of points on the process also in a response to luis’s remarks. starting point for us was you read it in 20th_february statements, the old program, the old mou. but we allowed uh, on two grounds, some flexibility for the institutions to work out a new agreement. once again for which the old mou is a basis. the first kind of flexibility was that the institutions, take with a commission have taken to account the new  and then we can continue to negotiate. uh, i think that will work. uh, so there needs to be a an agreement uh, and if he wants uh, a take it or leave it approach that is also possible, you can simply say yes. that is also an option, seriously because we are coming to the end of our time, our creativity, our options. uh, but if you have uh, last proposals that are feasible that will strengthen the credibility i have not seen them but strengthen the credibility, then there is little time left and that’s why in ask the institutions if they will still be prepared to look at that. um, i’m going to adjourn for lets say ten minutes to talk to the institutions uh, on what options we see eh, to move forward in this process. just ten minutes.",1900-01-01 01:41:40,2015-06-25 00:00:00

yanis varoufakis,"thank you, jeroen. thank you, colleagues. in our last meeting we were presented with quite a comprehensive set of documents from the institutions containing proposed prior actions. uh, debt sustainability analysis that was endorsed by the commission, but not by the… not fully, at least, by the international monetary fund, as well as, uh, a proposal regarding funding for the proposed period of the five month extension.",1900-01-01 00:01:11,2015-06-27 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"now, the prior actions that were presented, um, contain many parts that we consider very difficult to convince our parliament about. and therefore, they make it extremely onerous for us to pass through parliament this particular set of prior actions. now, even setting, however, that aside, uh, what makes in our estimation impossible to pass through parliament this comprehensive proposal by the institutions, is the lack of an answer to an important question. will these painful measures at least give us a period of tranquility, during which to carry out the reforms that we need to carry out? will a shock of optimism, c- counter the recessionary effect of the extra fiscal consolidation that is being expected of a country that has been in a recession for 21 consecutive, consecutive quarters?",1900-01-01 00:01:40,2015-06-27 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"and the answer to us, the honest answer is no. the institutions’ proposal is offering us no such prospect. as for the funding that is being put to us for the next five months, we consider it to be problematic in a variety of ways. firstly, it makes no provision for the states arrears caused by five months of making payments without disbursements. and of the falling tax revenues that are, uh, res- a re- a result of this prolonged negotiation, and the constant threat of grexit, which is wafting in the air.",1900-01-01 00:02:41,2015-06-27 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"secondly, the idea of dipping into the funds of the hfsf, i called it cannibalizing the hfsf, in order to repay the ecb’s smp bonds, bonds in july and august constitutes a clear and present danger. greece’s fragile banks, possibly through, um, an operation that deals with a m- mountainous npl’s that eant- eat into, uh, their capitalization, uh, could be stabilized.",1900-01-01 00:03:17,2015-06-27 00:00:00

yanis varoufakis,"so, a new program is embedded into this few month-long extension, even though it is not articulated as such. and that is, um, a very serious problem. i think that many of you would have problems pushing this through your parliaments, and i cannot take a proposal, a funding proposal to my parliament which includes a provision that you couldn’t put through your parliaments.",1900-01-01 00:04:56,2015-06-27 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"um, thirdly, the proposed disbursements schedule as presented to us by the institutions is a minefield of reviews. there is, i understand the problem of trust, but if you look at it technically, it means that we will have one review per month. our government, instead of concentrating on passing the important reforms that we need to reform… to- to- to- to pass, we are going to be constantly engaged, week in, week out from tomorrow in this reviewing process, which will lead to what?",1900-01-01 00:05:21,2015-06-27 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"it will lead to another negotiation like the one we had over the last five months, with the institutions, with the eurogroup, consecutive eurogroup meetings sometime in october, november, in order to determine the parameters of a new program, and i don’t think that none of us can actually take this process, um, as it is implied by this proposi- proposal of the institutions that was tabled here two days ago.",1900-01-01 00:05:52,2015-06-27 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"fourthly, given the that it is abundantly clear that our debt will remain unsustainable by the end of this year, and that market access will remain as distant as it has been of recent, it is our assessment that the international monetary fund cannot be counted upon to disperse each share 3.5 billion, the share that the institutions are counting as part of the funding package on the table. and that is another problem.",1900-01-01 00:06:23,2015-06-27 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"if i’m asked in parliament, my parliament what are the chances that this part of the funding package is going to be dispersed, in all honesty, i’ll have to say to them, minuscule. these are solid reasons why our government does not consider it has a mandate to accept the institutions’ proposal. and moreover, let’s be honest here, even if we were just for the benefit of ending this process and signing and sealing an agreement, we could not pass it through our parliament. and the result of that would be much worse than what we are doing now, the situation we found ourselves in now. it would mean that our government would fall, we would lose our, uh, support in parliament, and we would go into a process, an electoral process that would last a minimum of 23 days.",1900-01-01 00:06:50,2015-06-27 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"now, at the very same time, colleagues, our government does not have a mandate, and i want to insist on that, i want to, to, to ask for your, uh, attention here, we do not have a mandate to turn down the institutions’, uh, pro- proposals, out of hand. our party received 36% of, in the 25th of january election, together the two governing parties have just over 40% of the vote. fully cognizant of how weighty the present moment in history is, we feel obliged to put the institutions’ proposal to the people of greece.",1900-01-01 00:07:41,2015-06-27 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"we shall endeavor to spell out to them fully, what a yes to the institutions’ proposal means, to do the same regarding a no vote. we have our own recommendation but it is not binding on the greek people, it is they who are sovereign, uh, decision makers. and we are going to accept their verdict fully and we, we’ll do whatever it takes to implement it, one way or another.",1900-01-01 00:08:17,2015-06-27 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"we believe that calling a referendum is optimal given the constraints that we face because as i said, firstly, it’s the only alternative we have to, to a, uh, a collapse of the government, a failure to push through parliament the proposal of the institutions. but let me add another wrinkle to this, even if we managed somehow to pass it through our parliament, we would be facing a major problem of ownership of the program and implementation. put simply, just as in the past, greek governments pushed through policies dictated by the institutions, but could not carry the people with them, we too would fail in doing so.",1900-01-01 00:08:43,2015-06-27 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"so, let me now concentrate on the question we are going to be putting to the, to the greek people. much has been discussed as to what it will be. we are very clear on this, there is a proposal by the institutions, maybe it will change today, maybe it won’t. this is what we’re putting to the greek people, we’re asking them to instruct us, to accept it fully without further negotiations, which we shall do if the greek people tell us to do this, or to negotiate further, if there is room for further negotiations.",1900-01-01 00:09:28,2015-06-27 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"many journalists… i’ll wait and see if there is such a view here, comment and there is a logic to it, that this could be a referendum on the euro, well, on greece’s participation in the euro. let me be very clear on this, colleagues, our participation in euro, in the euro is not, and cannot be part of any referendum. let me remind you that the european union treaties have no… make no provisions for an exit from the euro, and it would be a violation of the eu treaties, for us to go anywhere near that question.",1900-01-01 00:10:02,2015-06-27 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"the question is very simple, there is a proposal by the institutions. the institutions worked very hard to come up with it. we could not bring ourselves to signing it for reasons i have explained, it is up to the greek people to decide. the suggestion that we’re coming to you with is that a one-month extension is offered of the existing arrangement so as to allow a smooth transition from today to the 6th of july so as to allow the greek people, in calmness to deliberate, to consider the proposal which is in front of them, and to make a considered judgment on that basis.",1900-01-01 00:10:37,2015-06-27 00:00:00

michael noonan,"and i thought that if we met today, uh, that’s why the gap wouldn’t be closed completely, that the gap would be narrowed somewhat, and that there would be a single paper, that, uh, the greek authorities could put to their parliament. but, uh, the prospective last round of negotiations that i anticipated is not now available because last night, the greek authorities decided to end the negotiations, uh, by announcing a referendum, and by saying that they would, uh, recommend to, to the greek people to turn down, uh, the paper of the institutions, uh, even though it’s full format was not yet decided, and was pending the result of today’s meeting.",1900-01-01 00:14:44,2015-06-27 00:00:00

michael noonan,"so, it leaves us all in, in a very difficult situation, and it also- also has brought about, uh, a situation in my view where, uh, the greek authorities, uh, and to a certain degree, all of us in politics across the eu, uh, are losing control of the situation. i think it’s moving now to a position where the markets and public opinion, particularly in greece, uh, is going to be the deciding factor. and, uh, we’re looking here, at, at the ipad and, uh, there are queues at atm machines in greece, uh, at the minute in athens.",1900-01-01 00:16:09,2015-06-27 00:00:00

yanis varoufakis,"that shows to what extent we were prepared to travel across a very large landscape to meet the institutions’ view. but the whole package, if you look at the funding, if you look at the debt situation, debt sustainability, is simply not one that i can recommend to the greek people as a package that is tough medicine. i do not mind tough medicine, but this is toxic. it is not a package that would actually work and prevent you from having to come back to this eurogroup meeting in two months time to have another such tedious round, discussing the lack of sustainability of the greek situation.",1900-01-01 00:23:47,2015-06-27 00:00:00

yanis varoufakis,"thank you, jeroen. well, the answer to, let me be, go straight to the answer that i’m, i want to give to michel sapin. the answer is, of course, yes. there’s always room for negotiation. there’s always room for deliberation. colleagues, the process is simple. the institutions and the members of state negotiate. the institutions have the final word on the draft agreement that is put to the eurogroup. if the members states and the ministers agree, okay. the great unanswered question is what happens if there is no agreement either because the government of the members states says no or because it differs to the electorate through a referendum as we have done?",1900-01-01 00:29:29,2015-06-27 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"then we enter uncharted territory, which we must chart together. but again, michel, we are here, we are open to having discussions and rest assured that if that global package is in equilibrium, to use an expression that you used earlier, uh, we will reconsider. but the question we have to answer to our own parliament and to our own people is, is this package that we agreed to? does it contain a significant probability that we will be able to recover in the next few months and set off on the road to recovery? if the answer is that we are agreeing to, um, a hurdle or a series of hurdles that come together, come attached with very stringent measures that enhance the recessionary elements without offering any chance of achieving escape velocity towards the end of this extension, then our recommendation will have to remain to the greek people that this is not a sustainable offer.",1900-01-01 00:34:04,2015-06-27 00:00:00

pier carlo padoan,"thank you jeroen. i guess, you all feel how difficult this moment is, and in moments like this one who likes to see most of clarity so that one can work out the implications and decisions, which i fully respect on any side. however, as i continue to listen to this discussion, to this ongoing debate between, uh, yanis and, and colleagues, uh, i get more and more confused. um, i’m more and more confused about what is the strategy of the greek authorities. uh, we are presented with the fact that this of course is absolutely in the right of the greek people and government that there is a referendum to vote yes or no to a proposal, which proposal? uh, may i ask, uh, politely whether you’re going to describe measure by measure, uh, alternatives by alternatives to the greek people what, uh, views are and what if, for instance, in the mind of the electorate there is agreement in one measure and disagreement on the other measure?",1900-01-01 00:38:42,2015-06-27 00:00:00
pier carlo padoan,"uh, i’m even more puzzled by the fact that as so stated the government is going to support a no rather than a yes. then as  was asking, what if the result is yes? is that a no confidence vote in the government? you also said, yanis, that you might want to ask greek people to have a mandate on a long-term program. is this a different referendum or is it going to be in the set of questions? and then if you, uh, ask for a mandate for a long-term program, are you going to also explain that in order to get the long-term program, which since the beginning i personally supported, there are some steps which are necessary given that there is a current program.",1900-01-01 00:39:48,2015-06-27 00:00:00
pier carlo padoan,"and finally, uh, are you going to discuss the consequences of whatever outcome the referendum is to greece or the greek people? and in general, uh, are, are you going to go beyond this specific point or are you going just to say that with the referendum, that’s the end of it? thank you, and sorry for adding questions, but-",1900-01-01 00:40:36,2015-06-27 00:00:00

yanis varoufakis,"pier carlo, your questions are, are spot on and i welcome them because clarity is necessary. let me be very clear, if the answer on sunday, the 6th, by the greek people is that we should sign, we will sign, and we will sign immediately. you’ve asked, pier carlo, very pertinent political question. does this mean that it will not, uh, will this not be a vote of lack of confidence, uh, withdrawal of confidence from the government? maybe it will be, maybe we’ll need to have a different governmental configuration that will pass the agreement as offered by the institutions through parliament. we will do whatever it takes… to quote mario, politically in order to remain faithful to the verdict of the greek people if the greek people say yes or no.",1900-01-01 00:41:12,2015-06-27 00:00:00

yanis varoufakis,"uh, you asked the question about the long-term. our objective, as you know, we have discussed with the two of us, was always to come to an agreement that might be tough, that might be, uh, bitter medicine, but which would come part and parcel of a broader package that would take grexit of the table. the greatest problem that the greek economy now has is the fear of grexit. this negative expectation which impedes investment, it impedes consumption, it impedes growth. this package as presented by institutions does not contain any hope of this in the near future. instead, what it promises is an ext- extension of the current uncertainty through one review after the other, leading to another negotiation like this. i think that it, i, i’m, i’m puzzled for once by the lack of comprehension of how important that is and our collective failure to come up with a package that doesn’t extend the crisis, pretending that it has solved it for a few months.",1900-01-01 00:42:43,2015-06-27 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"um, you asked me whether we are going to discuss the consequences of a no vote. yes we will, to the extent that it is possible to discuss consequences concerning an uncharted territory. but let me finish by asking, posing my own question. yes, this uncharted territory is very frightening for us. it’s devastating. it scares us. i’m sure it scares everyone. however, does this mean that because a no vote or a n- negative decision by a government like ours is scary? does this mean that a government li- our, like ours should accept any package proposed to it? i submit to you that if we’ve reached that point in europe, then we should reconsider what we have done.",1900-01-01 00:43:54,2015-06-27 00:00:00

mario draghi,"this adds up on to the already difficult situation of the non-performing loans towards the private sector. so, uh, all these, uh, developments that have been outlined, uh, put into question the two basic pillars upon which ela has been, uh, has been granted so far. what to do about banks. of course, uh, the, uh, bank of greece is the resolution authority at this point in time so we’ll consider and with the, with the help of course the of the, of the, of the commission and the ecb whether to adopt a moratorium or a resolution with greek banks or a bank holiday. we won’t be specific on all this point, uh, at this pointl in time.",1900-01-01 01:24:54,2015-06-27 00:00:00

mario draghi,"one word as, uh, as a conclusion. this, i mean we discussed, we went through this scenario of a gradually weakening banking system at the very beginning of our discussions here. i remember in this eurogroup. now, these scenarios now unfolded. it, it’s, uh, it’s unfolded and the main consequence since four or five months ago is that the recession simply got worse and worse. and the reasons why for this recession are two: uncertainty and lack of credit. and the recent developments have only increased both, uncertainty, uh, and will further worsen the line of credit. thank you.",1900-01-01 01:27:31,2015-06-27 00:00:00

christine lagarde,"tha- thank you very much. i would, uh, i have to say that from, uh, a personal perspective as well as from an imf perspective, i was also shocked, uh, when i found out at the very early hours of the morning that negotiations had stopped, uh, with the team and that referendum was announced by the prime minister of greece. i was certainly not involved in the consultation process that may have taken place in that respect and it came as a, as, as a massive, uh, surprise and a very sad development of this. um, clearly many of you have expressed, um, the frustration, the sadness, which i, i, i share as well. and, you know, acknowledging that this is a complete, uh, breaking point where what has just been described by alessandro and supplemented by mario is likely to unravel in the next hours.",1900-01-01 01:28:22,2015-06-27 00:00:00
christine lagarde,"i have to add that the, uh, probable, uh, consequence of that, although, i haven’t heard anything to the, to the contrary, might be the international community at large in the fall of the imf, which is, uh, possibly not going to receive the, uh, bundled payments that failed during the course of june and which are due for payment on tuesday, uh, close of business and for which, uh, i believe that a little bit of preparatory work needs to take place. uh, i would like to, uh, receive some, uh, assurance or one way or the other. and i also understand that the proposal to use the esm as we as a, as a proxy, uh, for greece was at some stage proposed and we’d be interested to explore that alternative on behalf of the international community, which is also at the table.",1900-01-01 01:29:26,2015-06-27 00:00:00
christine lagarde,"i would just like to submit one thing, um, i just cannot understand why, why greece says that there has been a total lack of confidence on the part of the creditors at large, including all the euro area member states as indicated by the . and at the same time when the negotiators recognized that between the three institutions’ joint proposal and the greece late, and greece later proposals, there is hardly any difference. and we’re so close, which i have slight doubt about. but if it is true that the greek position is very, very close to the three institutions, then to actually bridge that gap of lack of trust, it’s really on greece to make the gesture of moving in that direction and actually to decide not to go in that direction, not to go and clench a conclusion.",1900-01-01 01:30:20,2015-06-27 00:00:00
christine lagarde,"that would mean accepting the proposal by the three institutions, assuming it would be endorsed by the eurogroup numbers, of course, i don’t understand why this is not happening, and it falls on the greek party to actually do that. now, i understand equally that . it also rely heavily on assurance that subject implementation, the creditors, european partners will be there to support financially, to organize the debt operation if necessary, as provided under the dsa in order to give some financial future. but things clearly need to come in that sequential order, given the breach of trust that has taken place.",1900-01-01 01:31:25,2015-06-27 00:00:00

yanis varoufakis,"thank you, jeroen. i shall begin with a question that, uh, and the comment that my good friend on my right here, luis, made. um, luis, today in the eurogroup, we are making very important decisions, but nevertheless, as it has been said so many times, uh, ministers in this format do not negotiate as such, we don’t have the capacity to negotiate in this format. we negotiate with the institutions and the institutions, and we have been in negotiations for a long while now, and indeed when it comes to the sla, christine, we have come very close. it’s the rest of the package which we cannot possibly accept as it is. i explained it, i’ll explain it again.",1900-01-01 01:32:48,2015-06-27 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"but, colleagues, nobody needs to be reminded that tuesday is a hard deadline. as we are approaching, we’re approaching it over the last few days, it became abundantly clear to us that the institution’s basic offer to the greek government was, uh, not sustainable for the reasons that i’ve outlined and i’ll outline again. in view of this hard deadline on tuesday and the expiration of, uh, the agreement and the fact that we are moving into this awful uncharted territory, we called for a referendum in order to minimize the very high probability of an accident. as i said to you repeatedly, we do not believe that even if we campaigned very strongly in parliament in favor of the proposal of the institutions we would manage to push it through parliament. and then we would have three weeks, four weeks of uncertainty, so we would crash again. again, even more certainly.",1900-01-01 01:33:32,2015-06-27 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"um, alex, you mentioned disparagingly, i think, my prime minister and you said that he was, uh, referring to blackmail. that would be a terrible thing for my prime minister to have done. but then you proceeded in giving a 10-point list, i believe, then nine-point list, that could easily and fairly be interpreted as a set of outcomes from saying no to this proposal that smacks of a blackmail.",1900-01-01 01:34:38,2015-06-27 00:00:00

yanis varoufakis,"my, to my lithuanian colleague, i’ve only become a politician a few months ago and i committed never to engage in, uh, offensive statements or to respond to them. colleagues, the reason why we are where we are, in this impasse, is very clear. our government’s suggestion right from the beginning, which i articulated in the first meeting that i attended, was never really taken seriously. i can refer to it as the michel sapin principle, the principle of establishing common ground between the mo- mou, the existing an- mou and our government’s priorities.",1900-01-01 01:35:16,2015-06-27 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"for a fleeting moment on the 20th_february, we agreed on that. let me remind you that we, it took three eurogroups to reach the 20th_february agreement, the statement in which the mou was not mentioned precisely for that reason, to find, in exactly the way that michel sapin outlined on a number of occasions, this common ground between the priorities of the newly elected government and the mou. but since then we’ve been dragged back to the ou- mou and we’re being told that we can choose, we can make any sorts of, um, uh, we can have any sort of accommodation with the institution as long as it is the mou.",1900-01-01 01:35:56,2015-06-27 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"and christine, the let me now answer the question again, even if we agreed with the prior actions that you put forward to us, there is no legitimate funding package for the next five months. ev- and, and, and even if we set up a site, which is very hard to do, what lies at the end of the five-month period? another cliff, another negotiation, another deadline effect which unravels into the present and makes clear that the five months will be wasted from the perspective of establishing growth. there’s nothing to remove the fears of grexit from accepting this proposal. and this is what, why we’re taking this to the greek people.",1900-01-01 01:36:33,2015-06-27 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"now, and i’ll finish here, jeroen. allow me to submit it to you, that refusing to extend this agreement, the loan agreement, until after the greek people deliver their verdict on the following sunday, especially given that there’s a very strong probability, very strong probability, that the greek people will not listen to our recommendation and will vote for the institutions’, uh, proposal, to be signed immediately. refusing to give them the opportunity to pass their verdict will damage the credibility of the eurogroup as a democratic union of nations, permanently.",1900-01-01 01:37:18,2015-06-27 00:00:00
jeroen dijsselbloem,"right. colleagues. i’m going to try and come to a conclusion of this part of the meeting. i explicitly say this part of the meeting because if i think we will come to the conclusion that i have in my head, we will have to have a second part of the meeting which is about next steps. alex and wolfgang made that point quite early. but i think we should have the second part of the meeting. like i said, uh, first the conclusion of this part of the meeting.",1900-01-01 01:38:03,2015-06-27 00:00:00
jeroen dijsselbloem,"i think it is very important to realize that the institutions have worked very, very hard, critically hard to try and reach an agreement within the framework of the statement of the 20th_february, which allowed for some flexibility on different levels. institutions have throughout the process made use of that possibility, in that, putting in that flexibility. some effectively said maybe too much and have expressed their concerns about the credibility of the outcome. there was no final decision made on that because there was no agreement. okay, it needs to be stressed that the institutions abused taking into account also the current economic set back that greece have used, the flexibility that was allowed.",1900-01-01 01:38:39,2015-06-27 00:00:00
jeroen dijsselbloem,"at the end of our last meeting, we stressed that the door is still open and we ask the institutions to look at the last, which came in very late, the last proposal by the greek authorities and they have done so and if i now understand correctly, the talks continued even yesterday, even last night, until the greek representatives at the table were called back by their government and therefore the talk stopped. that is a fair description of the process till last night. and if yanis says, we are so close, then the question is quite fair, if so close, why walk away? um, but the greek government has decided pull out its people and therefore to break off the talks, however, regrettable.",1900-01-01 01:39:25,2015-06-27 00:00:00
jeroen dijsselbloem,"the government has rejected the joint position of the three institutions that was put on the table so far, uh, which is, in our minds, uh, uh, too early phase as on the technical side talks were still continuing and according to yanis, we were so close, some question that if that’s true, if that it’s true. we never got to the final stage of the talks, which could have been, could have been today. the government rejected therefore the position of the three institutions that was on the table and put in a proposal to the parliament, which is being discussed as we speak, a proposal to have a referendum in a week’s time with a negative advice of proposals that were not finished, finalized, nor part of an agreement, certainly not complete as michel spain so rightly said.",1900-01-01 01:40:22,2015-06-27 00:00:00
jeroen dijsselbloem,"so it’s also fair to question what has actually been put to the greek people, yet we’ve all said it is up to the greek authorities. they are sovereign in their decision to call for a referendum. they must decide what they put to the people. there is some, there are some questions to be asked about the fairness of the question. so be it. then if , if the outcome is a yes the greek government says they will implement it immediately, but questions have been raised, what is the credibility of that? we have the experience, all of us here in the eurogroup over the last years that programs only work if governments take ownership, and the government that has strongly criticized the program, and has put it negatively to its focus, would then implement it in that scenario, would also be a great, a matter of great concern that a number of you have raised that point.",1900-01-01 01:41:23,2015-06-27 00:00:00
jeroen dijsselbloem,"if the outcome is no, then apparently the greek government suggest to its people that there will be a better outcome, that they will renegotiate. but given the state of play, i don’t think that is a feasible possibility and i’m listening very careful to both the institutions and to the ministers that have said already flexibility’s run out. so that’s not very feasible, uh, way to move forward. all of this, uh, in combination with the fact that the government has been so negative on the results so far, the proposals by the institutions will go to a referendum with a negative vote and listening to you, there is no ground for an extension of the program, there is no support for that.",1900-01-01 01:42:16,2015-06-27 00:00:00

jeroen dijsselbloem,"what i would like to do is if we are uh, uh, on the same basis, if we agree along these lines, of course, i can’t expect the others to agree with my conclusion. so, uh, then we will try and draw out, i think our reasoning, uh, statements along these lines. i think it’s important to be very precise on theses conclusions. secondly, i think we should then close this meeting with eurogroup. i should have a press conference to make this public and we could, at a later moment, not too late, don’t worry, reconvene for an informal meeting of ministers of finance, 18 ministers of finance, that will be my proposal to talk about further steps we have to take to protect the eurozone, uh, eurozone countries and the monetary union as a whole.",1900-01-01 01:43:52,2015-06-27 00:00:00

thomas wieser,"yeah. uh, a pure continuation of the present program, uh, in factual terms, obviously not in legal terms, but in factual terms, uh, would also, uh, not appear to be appropriate as the economic situation has changed quite, uh, dramatically. greece would be in default, uh, the banks foreclosed, and therefore just having more of the same, uh, uh, would appear to be economically just not the right answer to this increasingly challenged situation, uh, where also, uh, the financial sector is under more stress, uh, than it was previously. so that, i would say is the background, uh, to, uh, the discussion around the application, uh, for an esm, uh, program. next procedural step, uh, would be your answering letter, uh, to prime minister, uh, uh, tsipras, i think. that’s all for the moment.",1900-01-01 00:01:45,2015-06-30 00:00:00

luis de guindos,"uh, well, the esm program, uh, everybody, everybody knows that, uh, you know, there is a lot of requirements, and, uh, it’s time consuming. uh, with respect to the extension of the program, i think that we all rejected an extension of the program last saturday. i don’t know what, uh, has been modified from our stance last saturday. and the third one, the re-profiling, the restructuring of the debt is something that is extremely, extremely delicate, as everybody knows. and i fully agree with, uh, with, uh, wolfgang, that, uh, you know, the last sentence of this letter is, uh, is, uh, you know, totally unacceptable.",1900-01-01 00:13:51,2015-06-30 00:00:00

alexander stubb,"very briefly, exactly the same points that were put forward by wolfgang, uh, and then later on by luis. as far as the first letter is concerned, uh, request number one, esm would take a long time, and would probably need extensive conditionality, because we’re talking about a two-year extension. uh, then the extension of efsf, we rejected that, and we continue to reject it. uh, and then a restructuring of the debt, uh, ah- we are not able to discuss that at this particular moment. i agree, this is a political letter, not a technical letter, and we can discuss further, when we get a second letter, and i would also propose to do that at some stage, uh, tomorrow.",1900-01-01 00:15:33,2015-06-30 00:00:00
jeroen dijsselbloem,"okay. can i just, uh, step in? i think, i’ve been listening to you  uh, i think so far this, uh, what you’ve said is there is no basis in this letter to reconsider our position of last saturday, that means that the time pressure tonight is, uh, is gone, uh, also for practical reasons, i think it’s impossible to go back to the question of the extension of the program. it will expire, and any further discussion will have to be, if any further discussion, it will have to be on a, a new, uh, kind of program. having said that, um, i think we shall, uh, await the second letter, to see whether there is a different political message in that letter, and i will set up a second meeting tomorrow, uh, after we’ve assessed the second letter.",1900-01-01 00:16:24,2015-06-30 00:00:00

yanis varoufakis,"thank you, yarun. i would like to say that there, there are two separate issues here. one concerns the letter, the second letter. and the second issue concerns the willingness of colleagues to contemplate the logic of our request. regarding the l- the letter, let me just m- yet again say that it has been sent. it is only one page long, because the rest of it is exactly as in the juncker proposal for the sla. so, um, pierre carlo, i understand your need to have a detailed account of our proposals, but the essence of what we are saying is, uh, pretty much as that of the institutions’ sla, and the amendments we are proposing are no more than one page, which has already been sent.",1900-01-01 00:17:18,2015-06-30 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"and regarding our stance on the referendum, as we’ve said, we are perfectly prepared to change that stance. on the question of, um, the last sentence in the prime minister’s letter, we are equally prepared to change the wording, uh, to, to being, not only fully committed, but also in a timely fashion, to service, uh, the greek government’s debt, and its obligation to its creditors. we are also quite willing to change the wording in a way that complies with the requirements of the eurogroup.",1900-01-01 00:18:12,2015-06-30 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"the second issue, which i mentioned, uh, r- right at the beginning, which concerns the logic of our request, that’s a, i think the more serious issue, and this is where, uh, from what i’ve heard, colleagues are reluctant, either reluctant to have a discussion about it, or they think that this is, uh, in- that this is a difficult juncture at which to settle the issue, and it concerns, for instance, the idea of a new e- esm program, uh, of the re-profiling of the debt request, of the extension of the efsf, that ale- alex, for instance, uh, and others rejected as a notion, and the, uh, presence, or absence in the new contract of the international m- mon- monetary fund.",1900-01-01 00:18:51,2015-06-30 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"so it, it, but i think that, given how critical this moment is, and in view of the pressures of time, it would be good to have an opinion, separately from the, from the letter, which, as i said, has already been sent, it’s a very short letter, uh, regarding the sla, um, y- l- why can’t we just imagine that this is not an issue, and then s- center upon the question of whether the, the, the four points i mentioned, of the logic of what we are proposing for a new program to begin from now, uh, whether they are at all palatable to colleagues? because if that is not the case, then the second letter is neither here nor there.",1900-01-01 00:19:36,2015-06-30 00:00:00
jeroen dijsselbloem,"um, yanis, i, i find it very difficult, and rather theoretical to discuss, uh, a second letter, or an amended first letter, or both, that i don’t know. um, you have to realize that the practical constraints, legal constraints, and political context, there is no possibility to return to the question we answered saturday, about the extension of the program. the program, unfortunately to say, will expire tonight. uh, practically we cannot change that, legally, it’s impossible, given procedures, politically the context, as we speak, has not, has not changed. so, uh, i repeat that my proposal will be to have a second tomorrow, take very seriously, uh, the letter, and any second letter also, but we would have to see it first, to be able to have an opinion on it. so you can’t really ask an opinion now, on the basis of documents that we don’t have, or that you will amend.",1900-01-01 00:20:19,2015-06-30 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"i appreciate that, yarun. can i just ask you a question? uh, if the, let- let’s imagine that that, that the one page that has already been sent to declan costello, was in front of everyone, and you could look at it, would you still ho- be of the opi- opinion that this program needs to expire, and we should talk about, uh, our request tomorrow?",1900-01-01 00:21:26,2015-06-30 00:00:00
jeroen dijsselbloem,"yes. because, um, uh, if undest- understand you correctly, your second letter has new detailed, changed proposals, the normal procedure would be that you would talk about these with the institutions, try to get an arrangement on the whole thing, then come to the eurogroup, etcetera, etcetera. we don’t have the time for that, it’s simply impossible. second point, the political context is that, uh,  a referendum was called with a negative advice, and so far i don’t believe your government has revoked negative advice.",1900-01-01 00:21:46,2015-06-30 00:00:00

jeroen dijsselbloem,"um, the, the two letters, the first one consisted of basically two main proposals: one to ask for extension, of course we are beyond that point and we also made that clear yesterday, and secondly to start talks on a new program, new financial support from the esf. the second letter basically said that greece could, um, is prepared to extend the last proposal by the institutions  but with a number of changes which i will ask the commission to reflect upon.",,2015-07-01 00:00:00
jeroen dijsselbloem,"um, i think we need to hear from the institutions how they assess the letters but also the situation, the political situation at the moment in greece and then i will turn to yanis to further explain what the situation actually is.",,2015-07-01 00:00:00

luis pierre,"– ok.  and we discuss that morning in the college with the agreement of the commission today we recommend that member states fully reserve the right to make a decision once there is more clarity on the situation. yesterday jeroen you asked the institutions to prepare an assessment of greece’s proposed amendments to the list of prior actions published on sunday. this has been done on the basis of yesterday’s letter and the views outlined, are shared, by the three institutions, but of course everybody can express opinion. firstly i must underline  that the document published on sunday relates to discussions on the extension of the efsf program.",1900-01-01 00:04:46,2015-07-01 00:00:00
luis pierre,moreover  circumstances plus the last request for new two year esm program which will involve larger financial needs means that changes will be needed compared to the reform package which was previously envisaged.,,2015-07-01 00:00:00
luis pierre,"any new esm program would of course have to be fully in line with the provisions of the esm treaty. as a general remark on greece’s proposals, many of them from our point of view lack clarity and specificity. so further discussions with the greek authorities will be needed to fully asses the impact our teams have not yet have the chance to do this.",,2015-07-01 00:00:00

um, some of the individual proposals could have merit as part of a comprehensive package. proper assessment is nonetheless required  proposal would represent a missed opportunity to simplify the vat system, a large administration is required to administer these discounts.",1900-01-01 00:06:45,2015-07-01 00:00:00
luis pierre,"
on fiscal structure measures and pensions: the government is proposing longer phasing periods for a number of measures, for example the elimination of  changes on the ika social top-up to be credible. this could be the way we need clarity on when the reforms will be legislated and implemented . we have been open to implement it, but not the legislating the latest phase out of eka provided comprehensive measures are found.",1900-01-01 00:07:36,2015-07-01 00:00:00
luis pierre,"
on the labor market, the proposal also deviates from the proposal of the institutions, and finally on product market the letter is more specific on some reforms compared to greece’s earlier proposals but they are less ambitious then the institution’s proposals, so more explanations should be given on proceeding with measures for example in response to the recommendation of  on the competition toolkit, we are not being able to evaluate some of proposals that have not been discussed in the so-called brussels group. proposals to split dei electricity company into separate legal entity on the state majority ownership also needs further careful strategy.",1900-01-01 00:08:14,2015-07-01 00:00:00

to sum up, i would say that at first site, measures proposed will not be sufficient to meet greece’s fiscal targets and will need further clarity of a number of the ideas in order to accept them properly, some of the measures have not been discussed properly in the brussels group.",1900-01-01 00:09:08,2015-07-01 00:00:00

benoît cœuré,"second the environment has changed, um due to the further delays in the implementation of the measures. also the damage caused to the economy through the turmoil of the last days, so these will need to be taken into account when  i would add one thing that the proposals can be explored further, but as they stand they widen the fiscal gap and also the environment around us has changed and both factors combined lead to larger financing needs and .",,2015-07-01 00:00:00

benoît cœuré,"
i have two additional remarks  the first additional remark is that a third program cannot be limited only to a list of prior actions so, um, the proposal of the institutions was meant to conclude the review , it was not meant to serve as a basis for an entire program. so of course, additional work would be needed to give a fully fledged, um, fully fleshed third program. and the second remark is that it is essential in our view that the greek government commits to service all its financial obligations fully and entirely consistent with the eurogroup statement of the 20th_february and the wording of the letter is not so reassuring in that respect, it says that the government is committed to service its external debts in a manner that ensures the viability of the greek economic growth and social cohesion. so these would need more clarity. i stop here.",1900-01-01 00:13:07,2015-07-01 00:00:00

klaus regling,"yes of course, that i can do and yeah, we discussed this in the ewg before this call and we, i sent a letter this morning to thomas weizer. this is the necessary requirement mandate in non payment to the imf, for that our board of directors can take the appropriate action. we agreed that this should happen on friday, i recommended in my letter that we should preserve our right to call that this to be the most appropriate course of action for the next few days given the uncertainty. there is nothing in our treaty that falls on such conservation of rights, can last. we agreed in the ewg that it would be reviewed on an ongoing basis at least once a week the ewg would review it, or more frequently if necessary and i think that was the broad consensus, to move in this direction. thank you.",,2015-07-01 00:00:00

jeroen dijsselbloem,yes. yes.,,2015-07-01 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"ok. thank you. right. let me begin with a few comments on the proposed prior actions of the greek government which were submitted to you, which now the institutions have had a chance to look at. i believe they were also discussed in the euroworking group just prior to this teleconference. we believe that the sla changed the prior action amendments that we are proposing fall well within the maximum flexibility of the mou process as described repeatedly to us by the institutions. very briefly let me mention the 8 points which are pertinent here.
one concerns the discount on vat of the islands. it is our estimate, and i believe that the institutions agree with our estimate that maintaining the discount along the lines of also what happens on island complexes anywhere in europe including the canary islands and so on, that the fiscal impact will be about 340 million of maintaining this discount. we have proposed equivalent measures that pertain to tax on rents on real estate rents and also some small increase on corporate tax.",,2015-07-01 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"the second point of difference, the second amendment, concerns the request, the requirement that individual business owners should advance immediately, a 100% of their tax payments. we have shifted that from 2016 to 2017 in order to soften the blow to them. 19:59 the phasing out of diesel tax subsidies for farmers we would like again to have a glide path leading to that in 2017.
on the question of pension reform both regarding the secondary pensions as well as ekas, the solidarity, rather small add-on to the lowest of the low of pensions, we are again in tune with what the institutions are requesting except that again we are recommending, requesting a longer period of adaptation.",,2015-07-01 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"as far as product markers are concerned, we‘d like to add here that the greek government, as probably is known to most colleagues, has entered into a firm collaboration with the oecd. the secretary general of the oecd and his staff have committed to a joint program with greece for creating, designing, implementing and monitoring the implementation of many more product market reforms and other kinds of reforms, like for instance the anti-corruption, procurement reforms and so on. and we would like these to be considered very positive steps from our government in order to pursue the reforming process, the structural reforming process which everybody wants to see being incorporated in greece.",,2015-07-01 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"
finally the, a couple more points, i won’t tire you more then is necessary, we had certain objections from the ministry of maritime affairs regarding ferry transportation on security and safety grounds and finally the question of the admie, the electricity sector reform where we are proposing that it be split by the  but is not privatized. this is the final change amendment that we are recommending. again let me say that we believe that these um amendments fall well within the realm of flexibility which is part and parcel of the review process.",1900-01-01 00:21:35,2015-07-01 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"
now, you asked me jeroen to commend on the political situation. let me be succinct on that and to the point. the referendum was called because we felt as a government that we did not have a mandate to answer the institutions’ call to accept this sla and the particular financing package as it was given to us. we said we will put it to the greek people the next sunday, who are the final arbiters of such decisions.",,2015-07-01 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"
again let me repeat what i said yesterday. we are fully committed and absolutely determined to implement the verdict of the greek people on sunday. so if the “yes” vote wins we will do whatever it takes in order to make sure that the institutions’ proposals of the 25th june, if the institutions feel like amending them, we will accept these amendments as well, will be signed, sealed and delivered within a very, very short space of time. the speech by the prime minister today, today, was a speech which was meant to say one thing: and that is that the concern of the government is, that whatever prior actions we undertake must be sustainable. there must be prior actions that are consistent with the reforms that greece needs and must be embedded in a program whose financing component is giving us hope. not just us, but to investors, to consumers, to, um, the markets, that greece will be out of the woods in the course of the agreement that we are signing. thank you.",1900-01-01 00:22:58,2015-07-01 00:00:00
jeroen dijsselbloem,"thank you. before, um, asking the ministers for their  can i make few remarks. i think the question of the extension of course has passed. the old program is  therefore also the validity of the proposals that were on the table by the institutions has gone to this extent that they were meant to come to a positive review of the old program. the old program is gone and will not be finished, there will not be a positive review. thirdly, in terms of the request for a new program, of course, as greece is a member of the eurozone and the esm, it will be taken into consideration and perhaps those proposals can be then of use, and also proposal of greek authorities can be of use. key question now is given the political circumstances each prime minister again today whether we should undertake any action on that request at this point, or await the referendum in greece. um, i shall ask for comments from the ministers before i say any more.",1900-01-01 00:24:27,2015-07-01 00:00:00

speaker,"secondly, with respect to the referendum i think that the argument that is so often repeated now that the greek government does not have a mandate to do this negotiation is simply running away from the responsibility of an elected government. and with respect to the argument that a yes vote will be implemented by the government i repeat that i said in earlier meetings i found this to be really intolerable as a state of, um, as a state of play.",,2015-07-01 00:00:00
speaker,"now, my third point would be that basically we are now in any case in a very different world then the one or two days ago. first of all the program has expired irrevocably and greece is secondly, effectively in default now. moreover, the economic and financial conditions of the country have substantially further deteriorated, not least because of the backtracking by the tsipras government on what have been achieved under the second program.",,2015-07-01 00:00:00

maria luis, may i present?
hello?
hello everyone. i just wanted to say that listening to what’s been said by the institutions and also by some of the colleagues, um, our position is that we fully respect the decision of the greek government go to referendum as mentioned in the last meeting. therefore we should wait for the outcome of the referendum before we decide what to do from there on. and i don’t know if it is necessary at this stage but i would say that i agree with the recommendation by klaus on the reservation of rights.",1900-01-01 00:30:57,2015-07-01 00:00:00
jeroen dijsselbloem,"thank you. i will come back to the point of the reservation of rights at the end. i believe there was a quite strong consensus in ewg on this, so maybe we can come back to it at the end. if anyone would feel different, than the proposal by klaus than they might express it. who else can i give the floor?",1900-01-01 00:31:50,2015-07-01 00:00:00

jeroen dijsselbloem,"yanis, would you like to respond?",,2015-07-01 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"yes, jeroen. we all know how negotiations unfold. we are often told in the eurogroup, we, the greek side, the greek representation, that x, y or z parliament does not permit our colleagues to enter into a discussion about matters which are of absolute importance to the sustainability for the greek program, like for instance, funding issues, remember the issue that i raised last week in brussels about dipping into hfsf funds in order to pay the smp bonds of july and august. we consider that to be highly problematic, regarding the bank recapitalization program, but we were told that a number of parliaments have prevented colleagues from even entering into such a discussion. so, the notion that a sovereign body, whether it’s a parliament or people who vote through referendum, exert pressure in the negotiations among ourselves in the eurogroup, it’s not unheard of, it’s part and parcel of what we do and that’s what prime minister tsipras said.",1900-01-01 00:32:56,2015-07-01 00:00:00

yanis varoufakis,"yes, thank you joreon, clearly it was. pier carlo, you asked what would the no be made of. no to what? well, firstly, the ballot paper is very explicit. it refers to 25th of june documents that were tabled and which were offered the greek government from the institutions, by the institutions. our recommendation of a no is not so much, i mean technically and legally concerns this particular set of documents which may, or may not, be on the table, but if you want me to answer in terms of the spirit of the exercise, we are saying no to an agreement which in our estimation, and i think in estimation of many people, is simply not sustainable given the funding package that accompanies it, given the debt sustainability analysis that is accompanying it, given the fact that were we to agree to those proposals, we would have reviews every month up until november and, in parallel to those reviews we would have to have another negotiations in order to discuss a third program by the end of november. this would create an unsustainable agreement, as far as we are concerned, so we are saying to the greek people to say no to that. a new program with the esm that can be agreed to on the basis of the sla and the prior actions that are on the table as we speak, would be utterly sustainable and of course to that we would say a big yes after the referendum on sunday.",1900-01-01 00:36:34,2015-07-01 00:00:00

i will try to formulate a conclusion. i think that, after realising that the current situation is that the old program has expired, the proposals that were put on the table last weekend by the institutions, were never part of the agreement in the eurogroup, they were never put to the eurogroup formally because there was no agreement, eurogroup never discussed financing needs, debt sustainability etc. that again has to be very clear. therefore, what the greek government is putting to its people is hard to understand. um, the request to extend your program, of course, is no longer valid, no longer realistic. the proposal to get a new financial support from the esm will be taken into consideration, we’ll start procedures, but given the current political situation, and as the greek government said, its lack of mandate, we must await the referendum on sunday. um, i will  the outline of the letter and communication after this call. i’m open to your comments",1900-01-01 00:45:50,2015-07-01 00:00:00

jeroen dijsselbloem,"jeroen, wolfgang.

wolfgang schäuble,i agree that for the time being  after the referendum.,,2015-07-01 00:00:00

jeroen dijsselbloem,"and one more point i want to make, there is a worrying sentence in the first letter about greece’s commitment to serve it’s external debt so i will also put in my letter a reference to what the greek authorities agreed on on 20th_february, there the greek authorities, in that eurogroup statement, reiterated their unequivocal commitment to honour their financial obligations to all their creditors fully and entirely. i think it’s very important to make that very clear how we see that commitment.",,2015-07-01 00:00:00
yanis varoufakis,"this is yanis. let me reiterate what i said yesterday in our conference that we are very happy to have this particular sentence amended as required to include timely, as well as fully, regarding the meeting of our obligations to our creditors.",1900-01-01 00:58:29,2015-07-01 00:00:00
jeroen dijsselbloem, i will still reiterate it in my short letter which i will send to the prime minister.,,2015-07-01 00:00:00
jeroen dijsselbloem,"thank you all, thank you for joining and we await the outcome of the referendum ",,2015-07-01 00:00:00
jeroen dijsselbloem,"my colleagues, thanks for your, your patience. we are in a very difficult situation in which the stakes are high… risks are high for all of us, yet we have not come to agreement. the papers, presented by the institutions, are not proposals, so i cannot ask your, will, not ask you, to take formal position there, or on those papers. papers that will only be relevant if there is an agreement. um, having said that, um, after sending the papers to you for information purposes, new proposals by the greek authorities came in.",1900-01-01 00:00:14,2015-06-25 00:00:00
jeroen dijsselbloem,"the, um, institutions that… we’ve just talked about this, uh, are prepared, uh, to look at that as quickly as possible to analyze it, to see if there are, um, let’s say useful proposals in, in that paper… uh, useful in the sense that it makes the, the text that, uh, the commit- the institutions will be working on more credible, strengthens, uh, the text in terms of, uh, fiscal targets, in terms of reforms, etc. if that’s the case, of course, then those proposals are very welcome and will be used. um, my proposal, or our proposal will be that, um, the institutions report to you on the outcome of their assessments of those last three proposals, uh, through the, uh, through the, your deputies in the euro working group.",,2015-06-25 00:00:00
jeroen dijsselbloem,"so i don’t expect you to wait or reconvene, or stay in brussels, uh, you will be reported back, uh, on the outcome that last, uh, assessment, uh, through the euro working group. secondly, um, i think the, um, the door, uh, is still open for proposals that strengthen package, or, uh, simply a positive reaction from the greek side on what’s on the table now. having said that, i’m fully aware that you, the ministers, have not said yes to what’s on the table now. and because i can only ask you for your formal opinion once there is an agreement. so, as always, the step will have to be the institutions and the greek side come to an agreement, this is still possible, uh, in the coming hours, coming day, um, and then we’ll come back to you to ask, uh, your formal opinion on what then is on the table.",,2015-06-25 00:00:00
jeroen dijsselbloem,"we will then, also, uh, have to go into how we decide the financing questions, and when and under what conditions we are prepared to come back to the issue of debt sustainability. um, what you have found in the papers are, uh, let’s say the opinion in the assessment of the institutions, but that is not, per se, what we can politically commit to, so… we will only come back to those questions if there is an agreement for us, between the institutions and the greek authorities. that is the normal procedure and that’s the way i want to do it. um, having said that, i think, um, in the weekend, we must be available for another eurogroup in either scenario. it could also be a scenario that there is no agreement, and then we must also, and i will say this without knowing exactly when and where, but possibly, on saturday morning to have a euro group.",,2015-06-25 00:00:00
jeroen dijsselbloem,"to either, uh, to take stock of an agreement if there is an agreement by then, between the institutions and the greek authorities, or talk about what needs to be done, uh, in the alternative scenario. um, the institutions have prepared, of course, the alternative scenario, there are different aspects there… the situation in greece, uh, our involvement and the help that we can give there. uh, the situation in some of our countries: ringfencing, financial sector, financial markets to consider. uh, and thirdly, the message that we give of politically how committed we are to the monetary union, and how we will strengthen it, uh, to, uh, to prove our commitment.",,2015-06-25 00:00:00
jeroen dijsselbloem,"that is also on the table right now, in the leader’s meeting, uh, where they are discussing the five presidents’ report. uh, but if, uh, necessary, my proposal will be to go into those… three main topics in the alternative scenario in, uh, if necessary, an extra eurogroup, possibly on saturday morning. i’m a little careful because i still have to report, that will also be my final point, i need to report to our government leaders and heads of state on where we are. i will report that, um, the eurogroup has not taken any decisions, simply because there is no agreement that was put to us.",,2015-06-25 00:00:00
jeroen dijsselbloem,"we were informed by the institutions on what the possible solution could be. the greek authorities have not agreed to it, and if they do agree to it then there are a number of political questions which still have to addressed in the eurogroup. so, yeah, basically, um, so there are two different phases to go through, first, get an agreement between the institutions and the greek authorities; secondly then, to get an agreement through here, in the eurogroup, that is not a given in advance, i’m well aware of that. um, of course, i can’t prejudge how our leaders will respond or whether they will task us to do more or try alternatives, or come to a decision, i don’t know that… until we will take, uh, that in our stride.",,2015-06-25 00:00:00
jeroen dijsselbloem,"that’s, i think, how we should move forward, so, uh, quickly summing up, the institutions will look at the latest greek proposals and they  will inform you through your working group. secondly, the door remains open. thirdly, i will report to the leaders that there is no agreement, uh, no formal position by the eurogroup at this point both on the issue of the package, uh, whether it is acceptable to the greeks and strong enough for the euro group, and the question of financing greece short-term or long-term.",,2015-06-25 00:00:00
jeroen dijsselbloem," uh, thirdly, we are ready to have a euroworking group, possibly on saturday morning. and then, the issue will be either an agreement… if then reached between the institutions and the greeks, or we will consider alternative scenarios on the base of the preparation by the european institutions.
