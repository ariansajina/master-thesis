speaker 2,"Uh, yes, uh, thank you, Jeroen. Well, uh, commission, uh, has, uh, carefully reviewed the reformed proposal sent yesterday to the, uh, President of Eurogroup. And, uh, this has been preceded by, uh, contractual exchanges, uh, over the weekend between the, between the Greek authorities and, uh, European commission, and also other, uh, institutions. So, in the review of the commission, this list is sufficiently comprehensive to be a valid starting point for a successful conclusion of the review as called for by the Eurogroup at it’s last, uh, meeting. Let me stress, uh, however, that the list does not include sufficient detail to allow us to assess each specific measure, and how that impacts on a budget, or on the overall program targets. Further specification of the reforms in this and other key areas, uh, is expected to be provided and agreed before the end of April. This is also in line with last week’s, uh, Eurogroup, uh, statement. Uh, we consider the Eurogroup statement of the last Friday as a basis.",2015-02-24 00:00:00,Unidentified

speaker 2,"Uh, it is therefore regrettable that, uh- … that the letter by the Minister does not, uh, directly to refer to the commitments in this, uh, statement, such as, for example, to deliver primary surpluses and financing proceeds  to guarantee that sustainability in line with November 2012 Eurogroup statement. Uh, we also find it rather unusual that the letter is not formally signed and does not refer to any actual government decision in this context. So the legal status of the letter is therefore not fully, uh, clear. Uh, importantly, this list does not substitute in any views, uh, memorandum of understandings, which constitutes the official legal basis for the program underpinning the master financial assistance facility agreement. It is also important to recall that the Greek authorities are permitted to refrain from any rollback of measures and unilateral changes to the policies and structural reforms that would negatively impact fiscal targets, economic recovery or financial stability as assessed by the institutions. Uh, Any policy initiatives therefore, should be discussed ex-ante with the three institutions. And now I would ask Pierre to, uh, elaborate further on some critical, uh, details.",2015-02-24 00:00:00,Unidentified
pierre moscovici,"Um, okay colleagues. Um, in general I would say we are encouraged by a number of commitments in  consider at all times the new government must, uh, take, uh, immediate visible steps to show determination for change in these areas. Believe a revision of the legal framework is, uh, needed. In other areas, urgent and deferential, uh, in- … urgent deferential and immediate decisions ought to be taken, uh, as the uncertainty of the past weeks has been, um, damaging and destructive. First, in the financial sector we believe the government must reiterate as soon as possible, in a very clear manner, uh, that key pillars of reform as agreed under the MOU, uh, to settle the markets and diplomatics. Uh, similarly, um, taxation and installments, the government must take urgent action, uh, to clarify it’s intentions, so that taxpayers begin to pay again taxes and social security contributions. And decisions should be taken, uh, swiftly in a full, uh, consultation with these three institutions. Uh, second, on privatization, um, our feeling is that the government should instruct the agency to proceed with the ongoing standards also swiftly. So, the commission, uh, looks forward to, to, to, to working with the new administration to, to elaborate what are, are still at the moment general commitments, and transform these into, uh, clear policy actions. We would also like to underline our willingness to continue to provide, uh, technical assistance in key areas, to, to assist in the design and, and the implementation of policies. Uh, to sum up, I won’t be longer, in the view of the commission, this is, is sufficiently comprehensive to be, uh, a valid starting point for a successful conclusion of the review. It is not at all something that means that the review is concluded or on the way to be concluded, and I think this was, uh, what we were asked by the Eurogroup, and our answer is clear on that point.",2015-02-24 00:00:00,European Commission
jeroen dijsselbloem,"Thank you very much, uh, as always, Pierre. Uh, let me turn to the uh, ECB. Mario?",2015-02-24 00:00:00,EG President
mario draghi,"Yes, thanks Jeroen. Thank you. As, uh, as we discussed the… in such short time, was certainly not possible for the authorities to come up with their own list of complete proposals and commitments, which would allow us, the institutions, but especially ECB to assess the impact on growth, public finances and financial stability. I note that the commitments outlined by the authorities differ from existing program commitments in a number of areas. But having said that, the list sent by the Greek authorities covers a wide range of reform areas, and in this sense it’s appreciably comprehensive to be a valid starting point for a successful conclusion of the review. Now, let me make a few additional remarks. We understand consistently with the Eurogroup decision last Friday, that the list doesn’t call into question that the current arrangement, and asks existing commitments in the current MOU and MEFP are the basis for the review. In cases where the list deviates from the MEFP and the MOU, we will assess during the review, where the measures which are not accepted by the authorities are replaced with measures of equal or better quality in terms of achieving the objectives of the program. We would appreciate if the Greek authorities would make very clear and public that there will be no rolling back of existing reforms or commitments in any of the areas mentioned in their list. Any new measures or laws in these areas will only be implemented once agreed with the three institutions. Unfortunately we still continue to hear conflicting messages between the communication to the Greek general public and the comit- and the commitments to this group. Second point concerns the payment culture. The list we are discussing today was not used for this purpose. In the coming days, we would expect very clear statements from the highest levels. The concern is to previous announcements. First, there will be no initiatives by the government on broadening or relaxing installment schemes, and the measures to strengthen tax enforcement and payment discipline will urgently be discussed with the three institutions. Unfortunately, even this morning, we are hearing conflicting message from Athens. Second, there would be no new moratorium on auctioning of residences, nor any other restrictions, which makes it difficult for banks to effectively work out the NTLs. I think it should be in the interest of Greece, first and foremost, to have a viable credit system. If banks are not viable, they won’t give any credit. I made this point several times. There will also be no initiative for any general or horizontal debt relief for private creditors. I mean, Jerome, with your agreement I would like to make a point on the difference between the Eurogroup statement and uh, this, uh, the statement here about the  bonds for bank recapitalization. Can I make it now?",2015-02-24 00:00:00,ECB
jeroen dijsselbloem," bonds, uh, would take place. It would be… it would take place on the basis of the ECB SSM decision. They are the ones who trigger the use of these funds, uh, for recapitalization purposes. Uh, that’s what we agreed in Eurogroup. Uh, any further debate on that issue, I think, should be… should take place in the Euro Working Group, if that’s all right.",2015-02-24 00:00:00,EG President

wolfgang schäuble,"Uh, I would be… Uh, uh, it must be totally clear, because I will cr- it will create, uh, in- incredible problems in my parliament. We have in, in no way any amendment through the given agreement. We have stated in… on, on, on Friday, um, onto the . Therefore, my, my, my, my demand is only don’t create the discussion or misunderstandings that there will be any amendment, uh, to the, to the given agreement.",2015-02-24 00:00:00,Germany
jeroen dijsselbloem,"Um, don’t worry uh, Wolfgang, there will be no changes or amendments to the statement we, we saw Friday. In that particular sentence, there are two aspects. One is, as you said that it’s… the release of these funds will be on request by the SSM, but you could also read they will be released on request by the SSM. In other words, formally, there may be a decision to be taken, um, but they will be released on request by the SSM. In other words, if the SSM finds it necessary, this recapitalization, the funds will be released. So there are both aspects in one sentence. Um, we’re not going to change the statement, that would cause a lot of problems of course. Uh, if anyone wants further clarification, I think it should take place in the Euro Working Group. It’ll be about procedures, but not about the political decision we took. If, um, I may be continue, I would like to, uh, ask, uh, Christine, for her assessment.",2015-02-24 00:00:00,EG President
christine lagarde,"Thank you very much, Jerome and good afternoon to all of you. I will not repeat the content of the letter that we issued last night. I could, uh, literally endorse and exalt all the points made by Mario, except the last one, which is quite separate. The two points I will come back to to insist upon, is number one, that the discussions on completion of the review, which should start as soon as possible, and for which we are ready, to be successful, can not be merely confined within the policy parameters outlined in the government list. And I think the reference to the MOU and the NESP by Mario was particularly relevant. The second concern that I have, which was also mentioned by Mario, is the constant and recurring noise that we hear from Athens, and which echo around the world in a way that is inconsistent with what is indicated in the memorandum of the list issued by the Greek authorities. And there is real constant reference to backtracking. That includes expectation of im- impending changes to the pension scheme that backtrack on policy commitments, as well as changes to the general tax, uh debt installment fees, that already have, uh, weakened, uh, the revenue collection by the Greek authorities. So, Yanis, if you would, with us on the call, I would urge you to reduce that noise and make very clear that there is one single list and not a Greek list separate from your list. Finally, I think it could be extremely helpful, certainly from our perspective, if, uh, Yanis could explain to all of us the government’s current liquidity position, as well as how it is proposed to move forward. With that, as I said, uh, we stand ready, and we’re eager to, uh, begin the real work, which will not be about putting, uh, words on, on paper, which will, we’re not associated to over the weekend, but that’s fine. But clearly, the actual review work now needs to begin. Thank you.",2015-02-24 00:00:00,IMF
jeroen dijsselbloem,"Thank you Christine. Um, I would now like to turn to Yanis to pick up on a couple of points raised. Uh, I think we all fully understand that the detailed work has yet to begin. Uh, and we must all fully understand that all the legal documents and the basis for the program of support is unchanged until further, um, works out, details discussed and agreed with the institutions. So that’s the basis on which we, uh, work. Uh, Yanis, can I ask you to react on the couple of issues raised by, uh, Mario and the Commission, uh, Christine?",2015-02-24 00:00:00,EG President
yanis varoufakis,"Yeah, sure. Thank you so much, uh, Jeroen. Let me… how I would begin by thanking, um, you, as the president of the Eurogroup, for your role in helping establish the necessary common ground to reach where we are at present. I also want, want to thank the institutions for, uh, um, the constructive relationship we had over the last 48 hours, and for so swiftly reading our list and coming to the verdict or the recommendation that you have come. I do believe, and the government believes, here in Athens, that we now have a firm basis on which to build a solid agreement, and, uh… for the next four months at least, and, uh, work towards, uh, the review. Let me now, uh, do as, uh, you said Jerome, and address, uh, some specific issues that were mentioned. Um, there are some minor issues which we can deal with very, very swiftly. That the letter wasn’t signed, it was sent at midnight, so, um, there were technical issues involved there, but we can deal with that. This is a response to one of the commissions points. Um, the question of no unilateral moves, and the need to collaborate with institutions in everything we do has been mentioned by all three institutions. I shall convey this view to my government. It is our in- intention not to make any such moves, as we have stated in our letter to the Eurogroup. We have, uh, every intention to collaborate with institutions and to make sure whatever we introduce in parliament and whatever measures are, um, discussed and deployed, uh, should be discussed and deployed in conjunction with agreement with institutions. Pierre Moscovici mentioned, uh, ELSTAT, the Greek statistics office, and suggested there should be no revision of the legal, um, framework and the autonomy. We understand perfectly well the need not to return to the bad old days of Greek statistics, and we as a government have absolutely no intention whatsoever of interfering with the work of ELSTAT. But let me say that this kind of autonomy has to cut both ways, in the sense that both Eurostat, and the Greek government, and every member state and all the institutions must have, um, confidence in the workings of ELSTAT. At the moment, I cannot tell you that I do. That is a separate issue from, uh, keeping ELSTAT at an arms length from government. What I would like to do is discuss with institutions and with Eurostat, ways in which we can regain confidence in ELSTAT. But that is completely separate from the point that Pierre Moscovici made. I shall reiterate the point. We shall under no circumstances, uh, do anything to jeopardize the autonomy of ELSTAT, uh, and we shall do nothing without the consent of the Commission of the IMF, of the ECB, uh, of the Eurogroup in this direction. But I do believe, this is the view that some of us in this government have, who’ve looked into the operation of ELSTAT over the last few months, that we need, uh, for all of us together to have another at the way that ELSTAT functions. Uh, but again, let me make this very clear, this is not something we intend to do alone. We want to do it in conjunction with you. Regarding the financial sector and tax compliance, this is a point that each one of you made, each one of the institutions made, um, there is, um, lack of trust regarding installment schemes. Let me remind you that this installment scheme that is now on the statutes in… here in Greece, was introduced by the previous government. And I do believe that, uh, the institutions had, uh, objections to that. We are happy to look at these, uh, installment schemes together with our… with, with institutions and with all our partners. There is a very crucial problem here. Th- th- th- th- the level of arrears, uh, tax arrears, as you probably all know reaches 90 percent of the Greek government budget. Now that is a huge amount that has to do with… is a result of the deep crisis of this, uh, social economy. And we need to deal with this, and we need to deal effectively with it by ensuring that whatever it is that we do does not encourage, indeed, punishes strategic non-payment, while at the same time finds ways of dealing with dealing, of giving those who can afford to pay a portion only of what they owe a way of doing this, especially given the current state of our financial situation. Um, on the NPLs, and I take very seriously what Mario Draghi and the ECB are saying about the need to, um, ensure that the capitalization of banks is not threatened by, uh, our policies regarding, um, NPLs. Again, it is important to note that we have very special circumstances in Greece, which I’ll not do… make any, um, uh, unilateral move on this, and of course we need to have the backing of the ECB in everything we do. But let me…since we are talking about this, let me point that, that there are special circumstances. We have a realistic market that has tanked and the notion that we are going to have options of first residences in order to bolster the capitalization of the banks is one that, uh, that needs to be discussed. And, uh, we need to discuss it with you. This is not the venue to do it. But there are serious worries that a massive increase in auctions, uh, in the tanking market is not going to help the banks while at the same time is going to create side-effects in the capacity of the social economy, both to increase, uh, the tax take of the government, and, uh, to increase economic activity. But let me say that, uh, this government is determined to discuss with institutions and arrange common agreement with them on how to deal with these, with these matters. Now, on the question that Mario Draghi raised regarding the FSF and the HFSF, uh, let me just state that, um, for the record to rest everyone… um, rest assure everyone that this government is not going to request for an amendment of the Friday Eurogroup agreement. Um, we are more than happy to go along with that agreement, and to see the FSF retain the control of the remaining funds, in order to use them for the purposes of recapitalization of the banking sector and resolution, possible resolution. Uh, on the, on the question of, uh, a rollback, especially when it comes to privatizations, um, on this matter, as you will see from our… from the relevant entry in our list, we have, uh, made it very clear that completed, uh, um, completed, uh, privatizations are going to be considered to be sacrosanct from this government. The ones that have been launched will be dealt with in accordance to the law, and in ways that, uh, combine the public interest with the need, the necessity of collaborating with institutions and with the Eurogroup. Let me finish by, uh, addressing Christine Lagarde’s two points. The first one is an assurance that I can give Christine and everybody in this conference call that there exists no separate Greek list, separate from the one you have. Of course, as you can imagine, our… this list is only, uh, a five page document. Uh, we have, uh, um a series of, uh, commitments to the Greek public. We shall not make any moves, as I said before, that, uh, undermine the bonds of trust that we are trying to build currently. Um, but there is no such thing as a separate Greek list. There may be different interpretations of, uh, the current, uh, state of negotiation, of exchange between us, of commitment. And let me just make this t- t- this point a bit more tangible. I heard from all three institutions the statement that, um, this list is not a replacement of the MOU, and that this list is going to simply being grafted upon the MOU or we will have to negotiate ways in which the current MOU will have to be amended. Now, as you know, we’ve spent three Eurogroups discussing the imperative of combining the existing program with, uh, the, the new government’s priorities. And I th- I have… I am… I was under the impression, and this government was under the impression that we are making a fresh start without challenging the legal existence of the MOU. We shall insist on maintaining, in a collegial manner, this constructive ambiguity, um, and we are going to try do, to do our, ou- our, our best in order to ensure that the review is completed, on the understanding that this governments, um, um, list that you have in front of you, is taken, um, as the starting point regarding th- th- the judgment that is going to be passed upon us over the next four months. The next four or five months is a very short space of time. If we can do what we agree that we should do by April, um, and do it in the spirit that con- that confirms both the existing program and the intention of moving on, and moving ahead, and moving to a new relationship after June, I think that will be an excellent way of moving ahead. I was asked also by Christine Lagarde to explain the liquidity condition of the government. I’m not in a situa- in, in, in, uh, in a position to do this presently. Uh, the… as you kn- as everybody knows, especially the International Monetary Fund, our liquid- liquidity condition given the destabilization of the Greek economy over the last two months, uh, is not good at all. But my understanding was that today, what we are doing is we are setting the scene, establishing the base, the foundation, for beginning immediate discussions on all those matters including the fiscal cap that we are facing over the next few weeks, in particular, the repayments of the IMF loans in installments, which are coming up soon. Um, it was a discussion we couldn’t have until today’s hurdle has been overcome, but it is a discussion that we are prepared to begin even tonight, if you so wish. Um, I think I have spoken enough. I want to thank, once more, the institutions. The way I understand this conference call is to answer the question whether our list is sufficiently comprehensive to act as the starting point of a process that will stabilize Greece and our relationship with, uh, the Eurogroup and the institutions, in order to build trust and to move ahead. Thank you.",2015-02-24 00:00:00,Greece
jeroen dijsselbloem,"Thank you, Yanis. Um, let me for, uh, opening, uh, the, the, the floor to other ministers. Uh, we iterate that the basis that we are working on is the Eurogroup statement which, um, uh, talks about on the base of the framework of the existing arrangements, uh, underpinned by a set of commitments which are then spelled out. And I think one of the key ones there is that starting from the current arrangement, there can be use of the given flexibility that had to be always after consulting and agreeing with the institutions any changes to the arrangements. I think that could… that clear issue, and you underlined the, um, uh… how the Greek government is committed on this point. Um, on top of that, we now have the list which is a third list of reform measures, based on the current arrangements and the institution that provided us with their first views, which, um, uh, was, if I summarize it, that the list is sufficiently comprehensive to be a valid starting point for a successful conclusion of the reissue. Um, I think those are the key, uh, elements. This is where we are, this is how we will work, and all of this… If the national procedures are started and successfully, um, finished by the end of the week, then, very intensively, the work can start on many of the issues that were brought up, uh, and, um, many of the issues that you mentioned.

And on this, on this basis, I think, uh, it would be, it would be very helpful, uh, that we will not, uh, uh, change anything that was just mentioned in the HFSF. And it must be totally clear what we are asking of our parliaments is an extension of the given agreement, nothing else. Not an amendment of the agreement. Uh, it has to be, uh, very clear. We will do it as, uh, already initiated to measure and the legislation procedures, I need to, of course, um, the, the common decision of the Eurogroup in this conference call, but I think on the, on, in, on the basis of the list we got from, from Greek authorities, uh, and uh, with, with, with the use of the three institutions, uh, we should, uh, we should move on in this way. I would, uh…  but I won’t like to repeat it. Uh, it was an issue of the budget 2015, that is a major issue for, for the ongoing review, uh, for the, for a successful revision of the program. And then I would like, uh, to add, uh, that in the list of the, of the Greek authorities, the BRRD implementation is not mentioned, and I think, uh, Greece, uh, should transpose this directive into Greek law as a matter of high priority.

I think it’s, uh, fair to remember that, um, this was only a first list of reform measures from the Greek authorities, which we asked, and it’s not been, uh, elaborated on, not been negotiated on with the institutions. So it is what it is, uh, and the question was formulated by the Eurogroup whether it was, um, comprehens- sufficiently comprehensive. So I think that’s where we stand, and that the real negotiations and getting the details right is a long process that’s yet to start.

Uh, it’s, um,  I’d also like to echo, um, thanking the institutions for the, this first assessment, and I’m sure we’ll all, all have a lot to discuss in, uh, in the coming weeks and months. But, uh, getting to the point that several colleagues raised, communication is critical here. So, uh, maybe you were going to say it anyway, but, uh, I think that we should have an agreement here on what communicators this will be. Letters of assessment via the institution have been made public. Uh, will there be a statement plus debate meeting?

The institutions provided us with their first view, that they consider this list of measures to be sufficiently comprehensive to be a valid starting point for a successful conclusion of the review. We therefore agreed to proceed with the national procedures, with a view to reaching the final decision on the extension by up to four months, on the current master financial assistance facility agreements. We call on the Greek authorities to further develop and broaden the list of reforms, measures in close coordination with the institutions, in order to allow for a speedy conclusion… I should say, a speedy and successful conclusion of the review.” So that is the draft statement. It should come in, uh, in, in your deputies email boxes. Perhaps you can, uh, look at it for a minute, and I would ask for reactions.",2015-02-24 00:00:00,EG President

declan costello,"The discussions-  Erm the  teams and the fiscal teams erm, starting on Friday erm, and then today the erm Financial Markets Instructional Reforms Team are, are starting their work. Erm, I won’t go into too much detail, I guess the, the main points here is that the frequency, the intensity and the detail of the interactions is not what we have witnessed erm, in the past and I think doesn’t provide us with the assurance that we would be able to erm, be able to reach a successful conclusion erm, by, by the end of April, unless there is a very, very big erm, acceleration in the face of, of interactions. Erm, we seem to be struggling on a number of points, erm, still. Erm, I think first, erm, there seems to be a difference of interpretation between ourselves and the Greek colleagues on the scope of, of the negotiations. Erm, we’re certainly sticking to the view that we need a comprehensive approach erm, touching upon all key policy reform areas. Of course within that we can look at a number of individual proposals put forward by the Greek authorities but we, we stick to the need to, to have this kind of comprehensive approach and be able to, to you know, to, to touch upon all key, erm, all key areas. Erm, in contrast I think the Greek colleagues seem to be having a more narrow, erm, more limited erm, focus of the discussion, concentrating erm, not exclusively, but almost exclusively on some of the key issues which they want to advance. Just to underline, we are prepared of course to discuss these, but, within a comprehensive erm, approach. Also I think there seems to be a difference of view on the, the depth of information exchange which needs to take place . Erm, as you know in the context of, of review. We really need to erm… the devil is in the detail. We really need an in-depth understanding, a fact-finding of what the situation is erm, what… how policies, or the implementation of policies to date, to, to date. And also to get a clear understanding… you know fact-finding at this stage of the policy intentions, of the government… erm, both the previous commitments but also any new measures they would envisage. So again, erm, we really see the need to step up the, the pace of intensity erm, of work here. Maybe I’ll just turn to the issue of the, erm, the unilateral actions and communications. We, we’re still erm, we’re still witnessing and experiencing, you know, a plethora of erm, policy announcements which come from different parts of the government which make it very difficult to, to really get a grasp on the, on, on the policy, on the policy intention. Erm, we have particular concerns about the bill being erm… which we think, we, we expect to be adopted tomorrow. Erm, as Marco mentioned there are some humanitarian measures erm, related to erm, access to electricity, housing and food, and here  it would, you know, we would welcome erm, having a bit more detail in terms of the implementation… the design of these measures, the budgetary costings. There was supposed to be a technical meeting on this today but unfortunately it was cancelled. Erm, but I think a wider concern is, in a sense, it still seems to be erm, turning into a bit of an omnibus bill erm, where different elements are being added to it. But when the bill was introduced to Parliament there was a number of additional chapters included in it, in this bill  without clarity, at this stage, on what… you know, what would replace it and what would come next.",2015-03-17 00:00:00,European Commission

Erm, I can be extremely short erm, on, erm, on most of the issues erm and start by saying that I erm, concur with what erm, Marco and Declan just said erm, 100%. I can subscribe to every word that Declan just said. So we, we certainly welcome very much, they type of .  making things simpler. Erm, this is now being overcome erm, but the discussion remains erm, constrained also as erm, as Declan highlighted, by erm, the lack of erm, breadth in the discussion. Erm, so we are still not covering the full spectrum of the issues erm, that are erm, being erm, listed erm, in the erm, in the MOU. And on those erm, reforms that are priority for the Greek government, which is accepted and erm, and compliant with the overall discussion, erm, we see a temptation erm, of unilateral action, erm and erm, I don’t have anything to add with, to, to what Declan said on erm, the, erm humanitarian erm, bill. Also the erm, new erm, instalment law, erm, is a matter of concern for us erm, we see a number of elements erm, that erm, are erm, elements of concerns. The, the law is extremely generous, in terms of the, the number of people and the level of income that would be covered. And also in terms of governance, erm, it seems to sideline erm, the Secretary General for Public Revenue. Erm, which is not the spirit of erm, the erm, governance reform of the tax administration which erm, generally erm, was erm, was the direction in which the Greek authorities were going. So I’m not going into too many details but there are elements of erm, unilateral action erm, which erm, are a matter of concern to us and the erm… I can fully subscribe to Declan’s conclusion that, if we want to erm, successfully conclude the review erm, in due time erm, there is a need, there is an urgent to erm, to step up the pace and intensity of the discussions. Erm, it’s not too late but erm, we are really running out of time here. Erm, and so there will be a need for a very significant acceleration erm, in… also in terms of the, of the breadth of the discussions. Erm, as regards the liquidity situation of the banks, erm, here we have better news. Erm, the liquidity conditions of the banks have started to level-off. Erm, deposit outflows have stabilized in recent weeks. Erm, but of course erm, future developments remain highly dependent erm, on the perception erm, of the overall situation of the progress and the discussion and on the perception of the funding erm, needs of the state. But the Central Bank operation so far, has been, has been broadly stable and erm, as is now erm, being erm, known… and week after week erm, the governing council of the ECB has not objected to increases erm, in, in emergency liquidity assistance. Erm, last week, and again erm, most likely erm, tomorrow, will be erm, not objecting to a, a further increase erm, in the liquidity which is provided by the Central Bank of Greece to the Greek banks. So liquidity is being provided to the private sector erm, and as you know erm, the erm… we are not providing liquidity erm, to fund the Greek government, which would be in breach with the treaty. So erm we maintain, we’ve maintained a monitoring threshold erm, in terms of the amount of T-bills held by Greek banks erm, that are in the ELA, to make sure that any additional liquidity, which is being provided by the Central Bank of Greece erm, is used to fund the private economy and is not being used  fund erm, the government, at a time where the government does not have market access.

There is a long, long list dated 23rd February erm, with a viewpoint end April. And only very, erm, detailed, structured, and technical examination of all the issues can reveal if such measures are fitting into the overall design erm, of our arrangements, or not. Erm, and if this is not the case, erm, then there can be no final and overall judgment. So I do indeed erm, believe erm, we need to push on. Erm, if the Greek Prime Minister thinks that he needs to push it… pull, push or whatever, shove it to the highest political level, this is, erm, I think extremely good and I would hope erm, that erm, come Friday erm, there will be an overall agreement erm, that we will be working on the basis erm, of erm, the Euro Group statement of 20th_february, which indeed also makes reference to previous agreements erm, that erm, have been had and which go back, erm as a matter of fact, erm, right back into erm December. So erm, I guess erm, what erm, we should be striving for, erm, is that we all agree, hopefully after, erm, many more important people have spoken, that we could agree, erm, to significantly accelerate work at the technical level. Erm, that this puts us into the position of being able to work within the existing erm, arrangements, identify what is jointly feasible and where erm, does one have to use, or does one want to use, the existing flexibility. Erm, if one wants to use the flexibility, one has to look closely, what does that mean for the overall erm, fiscal framework erm, etcetera.  would then lead to further erm, measures erm, on the parts erm, of erm, all of us. So, if… . Now erm, the communication has merely given us hope-  Erm, but just again erm, to repeat erm, that a significant degree of restraint would be highly desirable, erm, but I realize of course that now I am not talking to those who are not using that restraint, it is usually erm, at erm, other levels. Erm, so, maybe in closing, just a few words on the information, erm, which we’ve received on the national procedures erm, which are required for the EWG and HFSF board of directors’ decision on the former HFSF buffer. Erm, you’ve erm, all responded to the survey which was sent, erm, by the Secretariat, erm, the info will be analyzed erm, and there will be a proposal, how best to proceed, erm, at our next Euro Working Group meeting or even earlier at a call.

Now, as uh, uh… this has been ongoing for some time. It was considered to be uh, necessary to bring all of us up to speed so that we shared uh, the same information. I would ask the three institutions to brief us in the usual sequence on where we are in terms of the negotiations or discussions or whatever you want to call them, knowing of course that as per the 20th_february, with a target date of end of April, which we should be working towards. We also know that with the procedures that we have, we have significant parliamentary and other procedural requirements. So, we know that our timelines are fairly stretched. Uh, next week, as everybody knows, fortunately not yet in the media, there is Euro working groups/EFC Wednesday, Thursday. The week thereafter most of us will be meeting by chance, if not in Washington, and the week thereafter on the 24th and 25th we’ve got the informal ECOFIN and thus also a Eurogroup in Riga. So, these are the timelines. So, I will be asking the three institutions to brief us on where we are on these discussions. I have heard Nikos Theocarakis being in on this call. I will then ask Nikos Theocarakis to react and evaluate the situation from the point of view of the Greek authorities.

marco buti,"Hi, um, and welcome to everybody. Let me give you a broad view on how we see the programs that we have been making in the past days and weeks. We have also um, Declan Costello who’s our mission chief online. He may come in uh, to give you some further, further details and I hope I don’t  to provide detailed information to our teams who have been there in Athens for almost three weeks now. However, one should recognize that the pace and intensity of the dialogue uh, um, is, in our view, insufficient to reach an agreement by the end of April, and the end of April is what uh, Thomas you recall, has been the institutional deadline. Technical teams in Athens are starting to get essential information on the policy intentions of the government. Uh, you know, we, we have the experience of Greek officials attending the meetings who are uh, sometimes unaware of . Um, these institutions that have been- They uh, as other colleagues from the ECB or from the IMF will confirm, have been patient and flexible, but I mean, we have to see see, and search again and again, that working methods are not efficient, in particular when one considers the extreme urgency of the situation. I think it is high time to focus on the substance and not the the form of the negotiations and it is imperative to step up the pace of these discussions. I mean, to resend, I think it’s important that the Greek authorities need to ensure that the senior staff attend the technical meetings in Athens with a clear mandate to  government and we need to cover all policy matters on the issue and I think not only some of the priorities, which are tabled by the authorities. Um, I mean, they…. this is as far as, in general terms, a part of the meeting in Athens uh, um, goal. The discussions in the Brussels group were useful, but they essentially remain limited to the policy intention of the government and we are lacking the necessary details in almost all issues. And we know that the main details matter, as without, without, sufficient uh, level of in-depth discussion and details, we simply cannot make a meaningful assessment on individual reforms. Not uh, on the, on the package uh, as a whole. It is still not clear to us which measures the government is prepared to proceed with. And remember this, the 70 and the 30% divisions are prepared to proceed with so it will be formally part of the 70%, nor do we know what new measures are in the pipeline of… on the, on the, on the 70% less. I mean, based on discussions in the Brussels group, there seems to be the potential to common ground on a number of issues, including here the revision of the income tax code, the uh, the code of code, the modernization of the judicial system. Measures to tackle tax evasion and improve the VAT collection. Creating an independent tax administration. Removing unnecessary barriers to competition and making it easier to do business. We cannot proceed on the basis of intentions alone. I mean, we need to see  to banks is tackled so that people can afford to pay their loans, so people who afford to pay the loans and actually do so. I think it is unacceptable that people, that people with low income cannot afford to service the mortgage will be made homeless. So, this um… I think there’s a need to square this to objective by enabling banks to threaten to seize the assets of people with high income and also by ensuring that there is a functioning social safety uh, safety net. I mean, we uh, strongly urge the institutions to develop a targeted piece to protect the vulnerable in the society, including by uh, means-testing. Um, and there is no need to have a blanket extension on the moratoria on the foreclosure of primary, uh, primary residencies, nor there is a need to have an  for the payment of back taxes that is unrestricted with large debts up to one million euro. I mean, these policies… I mean, actually they run against the stated objective. They de facto favour the rich and punish the honest citizens with taxes. Now, the policy intentions are uh… as I indicated, not only in a number of instances unclear, but we continue to face cases of back-tracking. For instance, we remain concerned that the position of the national anti-corruption code has been de facto  of the privatization process has been substantially scaled back, which clearly has implications for the DAC, but also negative implications of competitive and FDI going forward. I mean, even if reforms are not planned for the near future, we need to have clarity on government intention regarding the system of minimum wage and collective bargaining. So, as you can see, I mean, from the examples I’ve given, we are far from having an agreement on a comprehensive and credible set of measures to deliver fiscal sustainability, financial sustainability and economic growth. I mean, the process uh, to which  and we continue to have meetings…. in meetings uh, this week. And we remain available uh, next week provided the authorities are well prepared. This is Athens up to the discussions, we are available to discuss in the Brussels group formation um, if and when the authorities wish to do so, and there are many issues left to discuss, including the fiscal targets for 2015 and beyond, as well as the post-June agreement. Maybe, Tomas, I can just say a word in general on the liquidity situation, which is uh, which is acute and be best alleviated by sticking to the process agreed by… I mean, with the Eurogroup and the leaders. I mean, this means reaching an agreement with the institutions on a credible package of reforms governing all policy, uh, policy areas. And we think it’s not very helpful to keep reopening the idea of proceeding with uh, a limited session reform to unlock some formal  exist in a number of Euro countries and technical assistance can be provided to enable uh, uh, this. Um, Thomas, I have been pretty long, but I wanted to give the feeling of where we stand on the various points. Thanks, thanks a lot.",2015-04-01 00:00:00,European Commission
thomas wieser,"No, Marco. I think that was very fine to give colleagues who are not as intimately associated with these discussions as the institutions are, a flavor of uh, where we are, at least from the point of view of the Commission…others may have other views. As usual, I turn now to Benoit.",2015-04-01 00:00:00,EWG President
benoît cœuré,"Yes, uh, good afternoon. I, um, let me start by uh… let me start by uh, saying that I uh, I fully concur with what Marco said. So, I don’t have to be very long. Uh, I will, I will um, confirm a number of points. First, related to the process and the general advancement of discussion and then I will focus on the uh, number of uh, financial issues which are closer to the ECB’s remit, financial liquidity. So, uh, starting with the uh… starting with the process, let me first thank the Greek colleagues and the authorities for the policy discussions that have taken place in Brussels. They’ve been extremely constructive. Uh, it was extremely good that all subjects could be fully discussed and uh, we uh, have seen a substantial broadening of the scope of the discussion, which really goes in the right uh, direction. Starting from the uh, list of initial discussion by the Greek authorities and then very broadly into the full range of economic, fiscal and reform issues. So, that’s certainly uh, very good. Um, let me uh, say however, that we are still at an early stage of the work, I would need that to conclude the review. Um, a number of, a number of policy intentions and initiatives by the government go in the right direction, which is very welcome. It is very relative that the authorities express a strong commitment to tackle corruption and vested interests in the Greek society and any step in that direction will have our staunchest support. Uh, that is most needed. Uh, many of these policy intentions, however, they remain relatively unspecific and as we all know, the devil normally lies in the details and so we look forward to work closely with the administration to design the policy plans. And the first step to understand that policy plan and then to discuss the details. So, that was a useful first stage, that we know how to go into more details to organize a number of areas, areas. Also, for us to be in a position to provide a costing uh, of these different measures. We appreciate the numbers that were sent by the uh, by the Greek authorities, but the role of the three institutions is to be able to, to, to check the numbers. Perform a judgment on the numbers and we’re not yet in a position to do that given the lack of details. And that, uh, and here the conclusion in terms of process is that it really lies in the uh, the pursuit of the discussions in Athens at a technical level. Um, as Marco has already said, uh, we have to note that a number of proposals here clearly uh, run counter to the current program and its objectives. This is not only about the labor market and the tax policies where there are obviously differences, but also in other fields, and as we, as we’ve already said in previous discussions and meetings, um, it is problematic that the authorities have proceeded to legislate in several areas uh, even before the discussion had started. Uh, and that includes the installment flow, the dismantling of the national anti-corruption coordinator, uh, and the transfer away from the  tax administration, which all go uh, uh, counter to the objective of either improving the governance of the tax system and/or even of improving the fairness of the system. And that’s related in particular to the installment law which is extremely generous and covers a number of households which clearly don’t have problems paying their taxes. Um, we um, uh, in terms of the speed of the process, as Marco said, we really are at a point where we need to speed up the process if we want to achieve the objective that we agreed in the Eurogroup meeting. We acknowledge the difficult  of the discussion in uh, in Athens and Brussels. And Marco said that we’ve been… our colleagues have been in Athens for three weeks, which is actually true, but the fact is that the, the, the real discussions in Athens have started last Friday. So, we have a record of four days of effective technical discussions in Athens. So out of these three weeks, only four days were intense, uh, useful, uh, uh, grinding out technical discussions in Athens. And that’s another thing that… so if we go in that direction, it is not enough. Um, the um, moving to the um… moving to the financial issues, uh,  around 107 billion euros and remember that the starting point was early December, 45 million euros, and it’s now 107 billion euros reliance of the central bank money. Which issues the goal of private funding from the Greek economy.  and fully share this objective. But it is designed in a way that is extremely broad that will benefit people that don’t need it. That will also undermine the financial sector and create moral hazard and undermine what is currently one of the remaining assets of the Greek economy, which is the healthy situation of the banks.  institution, uh, at arm’s length from the State, and we are concerned by the recent resignations of two members of the general council of the HFSF. Um, so uh, we urge the authorities to protect the governance of the HFSF and to uh, follow the procedures of the HFSF alaw its bank members in the regional council. That’s also very important for financial stability. Um, as a conclusion, let me say that uh, there are often references to these discussions to the ECB either reinstating the waiver or lifting the . That is a decision that will be taken by the governing council, including governance, and they have the advancement of the discussion and what the governing council will need to see to take a decision is a credible perspective of a successful conclusion of the review. So, what we’re discussing here is do we see a perspective of a successful conclusion as a review and the existing arrangement? Meaning that this not only about the pace of the discussion, but also, the breadth of the discussion. This is about potentially, ultimately, concluding the review, which is about covering the full range of the arrangement. Um, so that is uh, what we want to uh, to see and also what we want to hear from the EWB before the governing council of the ECB can attempt to discuss it in a meaningful way. I stop here for now.",2015-04-01 00:00:00,ECB

thomas wieser,"Um, that was even more clear, but, okay. Um, colleagues apparently have been very comprehensive and experiences more or less in parallel. Let me turn now to Nikos to give us the Greek perspective on how things have progressed especially over the last couple of . Hello.",2015-04-01 00:00:00,EWG President
nikos theocarakis,"Hello. Thank you, Thomas, for um…I would like to address several of the issues that uh, Marco and Benoit raised before. First of all, about the meetings of the technical teams in Athens and in Brussels group. I’m happy to note that you understand that it is a common understanding that the meetings in Brussels that last three days showed progress. And it was a better understanding from our side and the side of the institutions. Um, I’m also happy to note that you see that there is progress no the work that is done in Athens at the level of technical teams. Let me, however, remind you that uh, this was a very new process that has been established. That we have a meeting at the Brussels group level and then meetings at technical teams in Athens. So, we had to find out a way to cooperate with each other. So, at the beginning…when the modality has changed and people did not go to ministries and ask whatever type of data they liked. First the technical teams from the institutions were not well prepared. And there were no specific questions asked. At the second level, when we got specific question, we had, in actuality, an info glass. We were flooded with information that our people, and to be frank, our young government, could not answer to your heart’s content. So, communication was indeed suboptimal, but I think that recently, we have found a way to work in a more efficient and a more productive way, and since you understand and believe that our intentions are to give you as much information as you require to perform the review, we can carry on as long as it is necessary. And I think you understand very well that there is no stone walling from the part of the Greek government. So, in that respect, I think we have reached a modus mivendi in providing that information and we will continue to do so. So, the more we cooperate, the better the flow of information will be. Now, on the other hand, in uh, in the Brussels group meeting in the last three days, we have presented a number of our proposed reforms and we have actually put numbers on those reforms. And we compared the baseline scenario with reforms we intend to take that will affect that and produce a viable solution for Greece. In fact, after the discussions we had, we produced a new document that has taken into consideration all those comments we had received, which we have sent a few hours ago to the members of the Brussels group and I will be very happy to send a copy to all members of the Euro working group. Now, there are many issues I would like to address. For example, it was mentioned that there is a tendency, when a good measure has been adopted by the previous government, that to resist to adopt this measure simply because it has been adopted by the previous government. This is simply not true. To be frank, in many cases, when we entered minister’s offices, we find only the furniture. So, in some ways, we’re not even well informed about the work that has been done from our side. But, also, we know and I think you know, that our true intentions is to apply all those measures that would lead to the creation of a better, just, fair and more efficient state that is commensurate to the expectations of the Greek peopl and our partners in the European Union to which were invariably committed. For example, there are other international organizations such as the ILO or the OECD we’re working in close cooperation with them, there are teams as we speak from our ministries that go through the OECD people to produce agreements. So, this is not an ideological thing we’re talking about. And in fact, ideology works both ways. What you see as common sense, we see as ideology and vice versa. So, the idea is to find out what is optimal for Greece so that we have a viable, developing and growing economy that will make sustainable the payment of its debt. And I’m happy to know that… you know that we have reached agreements in many issues and that we are in the process of working even further With you to resolve matters that are subject of negotiations and that in some we can yield, and you know also that because we have specific commitments to the Greek people, there are other issues which we have costed and we shall not go back. Take pension reform for example. You call it a rollback. On the other hand, in the view of my government, reducing pension sharply for those on low pensions is not really a reform. We are in the process of reforming the pension system. This will take time, it will take actual studies, and all that. But we have costed that there’s a little more than one billion, not to accept the zero deficit clause in our pensions system. This will be done only for this year, and then we will, with your technical assistance, come up with a system that is both fair and viable. Regarding the issue of early retirement, I think we said that in the Brussels group, that our government is committed to pass a law that restricts early retirement in most cases, excepting those for example who are suddenly disability appears and the like. Privatization, another issue that has been raised. I think it is p- peculiar, to say the least, that a left-wing government is more sincere about privatization than a right-wing government. And there was a lot of talks about how much we are going to get from privatizations, but we are budgeting 1.5 billion, and we’re in the process of continuing the process. But in this process, we will improve vastly upon it, especially in the realm of offering safe and property rights to bidders. And minimizing the likelihood of legal challenges of the  led to the undoing of previous privatizations. In this sense, there’s nothing worse in privatizations about, uh, for the, uh, potential investor not to know that his bid is secure. So we would like to ask in the future, minimum investment provisions, state equity for the government, local economy development, and, uh, some minimum conditions for our employees, and we would like to escape the firesale logic. On the other hand, we tend to enhance the property right of the bidders by offering them things about the development of their properties, that were not there and in fact were gridlocked in, uh, those privatizations. So we are very clear about the privatizations we are going to do. We are going to respect everything that has been legally done by the previous government, and in fact increased the property rights of those who have entered in privatization agreement for the Greek government. Now regarding for example, issues like the moratorium of foreclosures. First, it has not been tabled in parliament yet, and also we believe that what can be seen as optimal at the micro level, what could be disastrous at the macro level, it is the fallacy of composition so to speak. Foreclosures of primary residents at the time when house prices are extremely depressed is in reality undermining the capitalization of the banks, seeing as they further reduce the value of the real estate portfolio. I think people from the Brussels group heard the, uh, Secretary General of Public Revenue, Katerina Savvaidou, discussing what a disaster was the attempt to go through auctions of people who actually had large properties. The, the, the problem was that there is no liquidity, there is no prospect, there are property taxes. No one wants to own property, so unless we accept a level of real estate of the past of real estate in Greece, that is absolutely out of the money, the, the whole thing would be disastrous in our case. So, uh, regarding collective bargaining, we of course willing to work with the ILO in establishing best practices and not going back to a system that was definitely not optimal. On the other hand, what do we see is that as a result of the agreements of the previous government, it has been a total dismantling of collective bargaining in Greece to a level that I don’t think that other European countries who have a history of, uh, worker’s right culture, so to speak, was there. So, and take another example. In labor market reforms, I think we know our little market better than other people, and one of the basic characteristics of our labor market is that one third of those employed, and let alone the one quarter of those… of the labor force who are unemployed, are undeclared, uninsured labor. So we said quite specifically, what we really need in terms of labor market reform is to make more important and more intense the inspection by the labor inspectorate so what that there is a crackdown on undeclared and uninsured labor. This would have very sizeable effects on our pension funds and I think we really underestimated that effect, uh, but say 150, uh, million euros. It will-",2015-04-01 00:00:00,Greece

So you will see there, when you read it, that we have incorporated feedback from the institutions during the discussion. So, uh, I will send it forthwith when we finish this review. But let me read and I think that we are in a very good, uh, direction with the institutions. Now, there is a problem however, that we should not let the review become a post-mortem. We are running out on the 9th. We shall not legislate in order to soak up from various organization the last drops of liquidity left. So in fact, there is no way that we can go beyond the 9th of April. We are very keen to continue with the Brussels groups and the technical team discussions in Athens. We are eager to introduce to parliament a number of reform bills very quickly pushing forward mutually agreed reforms. And to be frank, the very idea that the full final review will preceed an arrangement that looks after liquidity in the very short run is in our government’s view, quite unrealistic.",2015-04-01 00:00:00,Greece
thomas wieser,"So uh, we’ve now had, uh, uh, very, very, uh, uh, differentiated views over the process, uh, is, uh, quite frankly from Nikos, I haven’t… The only thing I gathered on process that’s, uh, you remain willing both in Athens and in Brussels, which I think is, uh, is very fine. Um, before I open up to colleagues to ask a question and comments , um, I would simply say, uh, what my understanding is in terms of the process. Uh, what, uh, we as the Euro working group, uh, need to do, uh, is, uh, wait until the three institutions and the Greek authorities have reached a complete, uh, agreement, uh, on a comprehensive views, uh, which is, uh, analyzed, uh, costed, uh, and, uh, which shows, uh, what the economic and fiscal policy consequences are. Uh, this is of course in a first, uh, iteration, this is not yet, uh,  the relevant national orders. Um, as an intermediate steps, I would like to pick up on, uh, that and also as an intermediate step permits to generate, uh, a credible perspective of a successful conclusion of the meeting. And a credible perspective of a successful conclusion of the review is in my view, and not only my view, uh, a complete list of measures, uh, which I think touches upon those which the Greek government, uh, is wishing to implement but which also needs to deal, uh, in a succinct manner, uh, with the other 30% percent  So, uh, I guess, uh, we are, from what I have heard, still quite a long way, even from this intermediate, uh, step, and I would, and, uh, uh, I would ask ask some questions A) on content and B) on procedure before we proceed.

thomas steffen,"Yeah, thank you. First on the, on the list, uh, maybe the three institutions could really help me, uh, what kind of list we are now, uh, talking about. Uh, if they’re approved, sent to the three institutions, uh, or are we talking about the list that is floating around, if I may call it like this, in the internet? I’m certainly a little bit puzzled about the state of, uh, play. And on the question of why we - I said, I simply have to send it to parliament immediately. This is very fine for me, but you should be aware of that, uh, first point. Second point on substance, would be very helpful to get some more information from the three institutions and maybe Marco could, uh, help us on the latest proposals coming from Athens. I guess, uh, this is part of the latest proposals, uh, that, uh, Greece again is proposing some debt relief, uh, which I fail to understand because, uh, Greece has subscribed to commit…uh, to honor its commitments. I don’t know whether this is true, but again, Marco maybe can help us. Second, on the proposed fiscal measures, as well as on the lower primary surplus, uh, I’m wondering if those, uh, measures, how the three institutions at the end of the day can confirm their sustainability. I simply, uh, don’t know, but to have some flavor, uh, again, would be quite helpful. Um, on process, Thomas I’m totally agreeing with your… what you just said. We need a, uh, complete agreement on the comprehensive, uh, list. And, uh, just to add to that, uh, let’s be as precise as possible because we are all under, I would call it democratic control, what I would need for any disbursement, which by the way would be very much in line with our statement 20th_february. I first need the staff level agreement, um, as you said, comprehensive one. Second I need a report of the state of play of the  including a debt sustainability analysis. I very much hope that the three institutions, uh, will be in a position to confirm that this is what they are working on. The third point is that I would need a compliance report on the implementation of all the measures by Greece. The fourth point I would need is an early warning if there are significant changes of the conditionalities in the MOU because as you know, and I’ve said that in the past several times, uh, I have to go to plenary of my parliament for any significant change of the, uh, MOU. And I’m sorry for that, but just to be as transparent as possible. And, uh, at the end of the day, on that basis, um, I can, uh, go to my bosses and to the parliament to suggest to disperse, um, the  to be a frequency in that we have, uh, we have ahead of us. So I would not see a real chance to disperse around the 9th of April just for the matter of, uh, clarity and, and honesty, uh, that we have. Thank you very much.",2015-04-01 00:00:00,Germany

Um, so y- y- y- you referred to, you… you referred to the possibility  um, intermediate step, uh, to work more with the team to create this credible, uh, prospect, also a, a positive outcome, um, that Benoit requested. Uh, I’m hearing my own voice, this is terrible. Um, but, but, correct me if I’m wrong, but this credi- credible prospect that Benoit was referring to was only about the waver. So the use of, of, uh, Greek government bonds is collateral and in my understanding, that would not help at all, uh, or at least not by much with liquidity. Uh, what would help with liquidity- … um, would be increasing the ceiling for CPOs, uh, the use of CPOs that as, as collateral, and then combined with, uh, realization of what supervi- supervisory fluxes, not to, to, to, uh, purchase, uh, T-bills by the bank. So it seems to me that, uh, that ECB… getting more ECB money in, in, uh, to, to help with liquidity might be quite a hurdle to meet. Maybe Benoit, Benoit could comment on, on that. Final point, um, I, uh, l- like Thomas, like Thomas said on, um, I mean, given the fact that we have two and a half weeks to go to our elections, it… the only, only disbursement that we could envisage in these circumstances would be one with, uh, with, uh, uh, staff level agreements on, on, on, uh, on the full review and any kind of, of, of passion would, would be totally impossible at this point.

Um, so Marco, comment?",2015-04-01 00:00:00,EWG President
marco buti,"Yes. Um, Thomas, uh, um, now the first point on, uh, uh, on the list. I mean, we have received a, a written opinion, Nikos reme- um, uh, the ne- uh, m- uh, recalls that, uh, um, in the last days, uh, uh, including, uh, this morning, um, which, uh, present the abuse of the authorities, uh, on, on a number of, uh, um, measures, um, and, and possible reforms. Um, I, uh, recall what you, Thomas, indicated at the very beginning, namely that there is a agreement that what would, uh, uh, emerge up the list, the list, would be, uh, something which, uh, has, uh, uh, the full backing of the institutions and not just simply let’s say the, um, ideas or proposals by the Greek authorities, precisely to, um, let’s say frame the n- the next thing in the process which would, uh… which may allow I think to, uh, uh, genuinely consider that the… by implementing those, uh, measures, um, the review would have a chance to be completed. And with that, uh, possibility an idea, I took under the council of Benoit, who can confirm or not, possibly, uh, unlock some decisions of the, uh, of the ECB, um, on, uh, the same matters which are under their, uh, um, responsibility, uh, which, uh, could, uh, if they come, uh… let’s say if, if they process insufficiently,  would leave them to, uh, alleviate some concern, uh, to the liquidity, uh, situation. Now, e- in the light of this, uh, while understanding, uh,  person material piece, l- I call it like that rather than, uh, than let’s say a list, um, uh, considering the, th- th- th- the usual institutional concerns that Thomas Stetton, uh, indicated, um, and, uh, let’s say in spite of the generosity of, uh, Nikos Theocarakis in terms of, uh, uh, putting this available for this… for the, you know, benefit of the knowledge of the colleagues, I would be a little bit weary on, um, uh, let’s say having a full distribution of this program and it may, uh, crystallize, um, let’s say the, um, the intentions around something which has not, uh, uh, yet the pa- the backing of the- … the institutions that needs to be discussed, uh, thoroughly in the process group. So we’ve seen what has been distributed by the Greek authorities, uh, uh, the  I know, uh… I do not know whether what is, uh, circulating on the web, uh, if this or not. I, I, I would hope that this is, uh, is, uh, uh, and, uh, would remain, uh, n- uh, confidential. Um, so this on, on one point. On the… I think on the, uh, 9th o- of uh, uh, April, uh, a deadline for the repayment, uh, um, I mean, I- and considering what has been, uh, said by colleagues, uh, and the state of play on the, uh, on the discussions, I would reiterate the, what I input at the very end of my previous intervention mainly that, um, um, we should on, you know, work on a double track. On the one hand clearly speed up for the, the whole process of discussions, uh, to come to, uh, let’s say to an agreed, uh, list which can be supported by the, by the all the institutions, and second, we would urge, uh, the Greek, uh, uh, government to offer, uh, a law on, uh, access to, uh, you know, resources in general government entities. Uh, I recall here that, uh, in number of countries including I think the country the president of the Eurogroup knows best, uh, uh, this, um, legislation exists, so it would not be anything, uh, you know, really specific or unprecedented. At the same time I think would, uh, be very helpful. We are, uh, as I said, uh, ready to provide our technical, uh, support, uh, also with the help of the countries having this type of legislation to help the Greek, uh, uh the Greek problems.  And, uh, on, uh, I think on the question Thomas  on the, uh, on the debt relief, uh, I mean maybe Nikos should be the one, uh, who, uh, replies. We stick to the agreement that today is fully supported by all the parties, uh, uh, all the countries in the Eurogroup. Namely that, that fully repayment, uh, off all the creditors, uh, will, uh, take place and there is a Greek commitment on, uh, on, uh, on that. Let me say also that in terms of technical, uh, technical support, we are ready to, um, uh, engage and to help the Greek authorities, uh, uh, also on the, uh, issues of, um, what we call the humanitarian, uh, um, concerns. So to pass, uh, uh, laws which allow to in- indeed, uh, help them to establish proper safety net, uh, to tackle and uh, uh, social issues. Uh, in a way, uh, as I indicated before which would not be let’s say detrimental or having possibly unintended, uh, uh, dam- damaging effects on other, on other parts. I mean, we are m- we’re supposed to be objective and we are fully behind it, and, uh, we are ready to help out, uh, on this. Maybe I can, uh, I can stop here.

So what we are discussing here is a, a, a start that can, uh, bring, uh, Greece back to market access. And anything that the ECB can do on or not do,uh, will just be a consequence of this process. So it is not . Now coming to the, to the consequence that the governing council could draw, um, there are two separate issues. Uh, the first issue relates to the waiver the, and, uh, as, uh, as I said, uh, the, uh, waiver is about, uh, having the programs  and so that’s about having a credible perspective of, uh, a conclusion of the lev- of a success- successful conclusion of the review. And that’s what we need to see to the reinstate the waiver. The second issue which is, which is separate, uh, is about the  financing. Um, and we’ve had two di- two different discussions, uh, that, uh, that the governing council will discuss, uh, based on different criteria. So, uh, you can have one or the other or both or neither of the two, it depends on, on the, on the first one… on the one hand for the prospect for successful conclusion of the review. On the second hand, the prospect uh, of, uh, a  regaining market effort, and that’s two different discussions. So, uh, uh, a- and, uh, the extent of the discussion we’re having today is that it’s anyway too early, uh, to put that discussion to the governing council.

luca antonio ricci,"Thank you, Thomas, uh, let me just come to a couple of points that were, that were very raised. So, first on the fiscal measures that we have seen. It’s very clear that the fiscal measures that have been put on the table are moving away from parametric measures, measures that are very easy to implement and easy to collect, to minuscule measures that have a very weak history of collections in Greece. As such, the, the use that the authorities are considering are far too optimistic. Clearly a lot more technical discussions need to go into this but where it currently stands, ’cause we feel the measures that have been put on the table which was just way, way too optimistic. Now, in terms of the way the system measures  surplus target that was set for last year.  is 1.5% of GDP, the authorities are, are projecting that they will fall very far short of that. The technical discussions are continuing and we think that there could actually be a deficit that would be registered last year and this is entirely because of non-implementation of measures and backtracking of measures in the later part of last year by the previous government. This will of course impact the base for 2015 and, again, the technical discussions need to take place but, uh,  We need to summarize, uh, the, and coming back to some of the points that we made earlier even in regards to, uh, even in regards to the list, uh, that the authorities have put forth. On process, there has been some progress. But on substance the snapshot of where we stand today, is that we are very far apart on issues of . Let me stop there. Thank you.",2015-04-01 00:00:00,IMF

nikos theocarakis,"Okay. So, let me redirect again that we’re soon running out of money and it’s very hard to go beyond the ninth of April. Now, uh, Marco, both Marco and Benoit mentioned the extra cash that is, there available, and that uh, requires legislation, but in our Parliament we haven’t passed such legislation, since it would not suffice both for IMF repayments and paying for wages and pensions. So it would not make a difference. Now, recall that our stressed State already made payments of almost seven billion this year without having benefited from scheduled disbursements. So we paid seven billion but received none. Now, regarding the measures list. Now the Brussels group has received a comprehensive list in Excel form of our reform proposals that demonstrate the 70, 30 mix that these, which measures from the tenth of December list from the institution we accept and which we propose to change and how. Today, we improved on that list after the discussions we had in the Brussels group and we have sent this detailed document outlining our proposal for each one of these measures, both the 70% and the 30% parts. Now, I understand that, and I think everybody understands, that this is a working document that reflects the position of the Greek government. Of course it’s not something that has been agreed by all parties. But our, actually, I would like to send this document to the members of the Euro working group. I mean, you know, your trusted colleagues, I mean it is to you that we, uh, address our reform proposals.

thomas wieser,"Uh, I think I get the gist. Any other further questions, comments? So, maybe let me try and  Thanks very much for this clarification. Let me, uh, try and summarize where, where we are. Uh, from, from, from the institutions, um, from the Greek authorities, there are obviously quite significantly differing perceptions of, uh, where we are. But let me first start off, uh, maybe with the question of the list. Uh, the list, uh, is for me some kind of intermediate, uh, product. I would not wish, uh, to have knowledge of it if I can avoid it somehow. Um, and, uh, this would be, uh, in all, uh, program discussions that we have ever had, uh, a first. And I think it was with a very good reason that we have not, uh, interfered in this process between the institutions and the country, uh, concerned, uh, for very good reasons and I think our Irish and Cypriot and Portuguese and Spanish, uh, colleagues can very much, uh, testify to that fact, because generating a huge chapter and preconceived notions about what should be in the list, what should not be in the list. How it is to be evaluated, how it is to be costed, uh, what effects on the DSA are. Uh, all of a sudden you get a viral process, uh, with, with a huge multiplier and you will never ever be able to catch this cacaphony, so quite frankly, having shot itself successfully in one knee,, this process of wanting to publish it, to me, looks a bit like looking for the second knee um. It’s something you guys don’t wanna know uh, and if you’re, uh, minister, you don’t wanna know officially. If your minister, uh, wants, uh, starts accusing you of not having it, download it from the Internet, it’s been leaked anyway. Uh, call the Financial Times, whatever. Uh, but I would, uh, seriously counsel Nikos Theocarakis against circulating it. If Nikos Theocarakis wants to circulate it, it’s very much, it’s, it’s your decision, uh, because and, uh, be free to do it. I’m just trying to give, uh, uh, advice with only one interest in mind. That is succesful and rapid conclusion of this process, but it’s your choice, quite obviously. Secondly, uh, where do we stand. Um, we are at, more at the beginning, I think, of a process, uh, than reaching the end of a process. Uh, Nikos Theocarakis said that the teams of the three institutions were technically ill-prepared. Quite frankly, we’re nine weeks after, uh, uh, the elections. Uh, I think it will give that indeed that there have only been four days of some serious dicussions. And at least in all of my experience which covers also some decades, uh, with some relation to IMF programs and this is the first time I’ve heard this of the technical teams were ill-prepared, but there also a first, obviously. So, uh, I think after nine weeks we, we hopefully should have now arrived at the stage, uh,  process. It is clear from what colleagues from the institutions have said, uh, that we are still a very long way, uh, away from this being an agreed list, making full use of the flexibility that is in, in the program, of course. Uh, but first one needs to define, and I think the Greek colleagues have done this, one needs to define what do the Greek authorities want, uh, and then one needs to have an agreed process and how do we deal with all the other things, uh, that for a variety of reasons the Greek authorities, at this stage, do not feel like doing. So it needs to, how does one deal with the  from the Greek institutions, uh, participate, uh, and that, uh, people are empowered, to so say what needs to be, uh, said there. Um, so I think, uh, uh, that this should be possible. Um, the information by the institutions that there has been quite some backtracking, uh, Nikos Theocarakis  estimates that the Greek colleagues have, uh, provided. Uh, in terms of timing, in terms of timing, I am working on the assumption that colleagues, both in Athens and in Brussels, uh, will continue to work, uh, around the clock. As I don’t want to know the list, uh, I don’t know how large the data towards an intermediate solution is but from what was said today, uh, it appears not to be a matter of hours or days but more, uh, of a longer process. It also  that this would require decisions presumably, uh, at the political level in Athens to include things in the list or to exclude things from the list as the case, uh, may be. Which, uh, implies that we will, at the Euro working group, which we will be having next Wednesday, uh, another update. This is exactly another week from now so we will have an update, uh, to hear what have been the achievements in Athens, what have been the achievements in Brussels, uh, in the intervening, uh, week and I hope that these achievements will have been, uh, very, very significant. Will they suffice in order to produce this final, uh, intermediate paper which is so comprehensive and so costed, and that it forms a very credible basis and prospective for successful conclusion of the review, I simply do not know. Uh, if you turn up for this on Wednesday one minute, uh, before the meeting starts, I will be very happy. We will postpone the meeting, uh, for an hour in order to be able to get a first look at it. So I would very, very much welcome that. Um, let us work on the assumption that maybe that maybe it would not be possible, um, because if it is possible then we take take it, uh, from there. If it is not possible, um, as I said, uh, then, uh, the following week everybody decamps to Washington I would very much hope that the technical teams continue, uh, discussions also in Brussels may continue and then we are moving, uh, steadily towards the Eurogroup on the 24th of April in Riga. I think it is absolutely paramount importance that we have a Euro working group, at least in this form of a conference call, at the beginning of the week so that ministers enter the Eurogroup, completely informed. As, uh, as is the case for next Wednesday, uh, I would very much hope that this very comprehensive, fully costed, uh, and mutually accepted list of measures would be available. Then, if I have not been precise enough, in previous rounds, uh, this comprehensiveness is not  it is one, uh, which bears the signature of not only the Greek authorities but of the three institutions, uh, or four institutions involved that is fully clear, but I think this would’ve been clear anyway. If that were to be the case that there is then that agreement, uh, I would, and this is recommended by the institutions, I could imagine that ministers in the Euro group produce a statement, uh, welcoming this production of a comprehensive, fully costed, mutually accepted, acceptable and positive list, uh, which should pave the way as it is so comprehensive, uh, for producing later  and ultimately, after implementation and compliance reports, uh, disbursements. So, um, there is one strand of possibility that we have this agreement reaching us by, uh, next Wednesday. That requires a huge amount of work and a fabulous, uh, speeding up of technical experts work in Athens. Uh, if that is not the case, I think our next round to do, uh, after next Wednesday, uh, would be 10 days or 12 days  of the week where Riga takes place. I think a number of suggestions have been made, uh, on the liquidity issue, I don’t think that this is the place or the time to go into that or any detail. Let me just finish by reminding our Greek colleagues, uh, that there are rules in place which govern, uh, the selection of personal through the HFSF which is required, which are required, which have been put into place by mutual consent, as part of the overall arrangement in order to ensure that the HFSF is indeed, uh, an institution which is run at arms length from any government. So this is not a political issue. This is a generic governance issue, uh, the selection procedures which involve the Euro working group have been respected in the past and if they were not respected this time around, and there are rules  So, uh, that would be, yeah. That would be more or less how I see, uh, the process and, uh, the procedure. If there is anybody with violent, uh, disagreement with this, this is now the time, uh, to say so, uh, other than that we would be seeing each other next Wednesday, uh, and if something, uh, uh, spectacular, dramatic, of very good news, happens in the meantime, I would expect that the institutions would inform us and I could inform you in turn.",2015-04-01 00:00:00,EWG President

thomas wieser,"Yeah, it’s a mutual problem. It’s not only your problem, it’s a mutual problem.

But so this has been bandied about by people who don’t know anything about the process, uh, which doesn’t help us very much. So, uh, if, uh, for the future, we can keep expectations, uh, low to the ground, uh, in our domest-, amongst our domestic audiences, uh, keep to the confidentiality, uh, which is, uh, uh, required also by our statutes. Maybe we have a short discussion of these issues, uh, of how we work, uh, um, what the confidentiality issues are, and how things are spread back home, et cetera, et cetera. Maybe we’ll have a short talk on these issues, uh, when we meet next week again. So my preference is that, uh, none of you, uh, of course, uh, uh, produces any statements to the press. My very strong preference is that nobody asks me about it. But if I’m asked, I will respond exactly along the lines that I have just mentioned. Okay, thanks very much.

jeroen dijsselbloem,"Uh, Pierre, , welcome. Thank you for joining us. Um, the next item on the agenda is the,uh, situation in Greece. Uh, as you all vividly remember on the 20th_february and on the 24th of February, we agreed on, um, the starting point of the process and how the process should be managed. Starting point and of course the current program, allowing for flexibility, to-changes to be put in the program within the parameters of the program. And that process, um, has been going on since then and, um, we all share the urgency, sense of urgency of the need to make progress, to get the-that deal. So implementation can once again start. I would like to use this, um, uh, discussion now to be updated. First of all by the institutions, where we are, what progress has been made and what th-the key issues are, so we are informed and understand the state of play and of course I will also ask Yanis his perspective on the situation and his expectations for the coming weeks. Um, I think I will do it in one round, uh, and ask Pierre to inform us first unless Yanis wants to take the floor first, it’s up to you.",2015-04-24 00:00:00,EG President
pierre moscovici,"Thank you Jeroen. Um, let me um, begin by saying that we uh, welcome the Greek authorities’ intention to cooperate with the Euro area and IMF and to work with the institutions. Following February’s agreement which is uh, our roadmap Greek authorities shared drafts set by these initiatives uh, further material provided in the course of March and April uh, has represented useful contributions uh, that in talks, in Brussels, in Athens, in Paris uh, they have been held in goodwill, uh, with discussions more open and focused and covered a wide range of issues. Uh, however, we must acknowledge that today, that only very small steps uh, have been made in terms of narrowing the policy gap. Overall, uh, current policy intentions do not yet represent what we expect, which is a critical package, measures that could deliver sustainable public finances, some financial system and a competitive economy. Uh, and discussions are moving, but in our view, they are moving slowly and let’s tell it as we believe it, far too slowly. Uh, unless change here seems difficult to achieve in the next week, a comprehensive package that offers a credible prospect of being able to complete the review. We need clarity, specifically to have confidence in the robustness and credibility of actions in the areas which have been indicated and others. Um, we have seen, uh, limited ambition uh, in key reform areas such as labor market, uh, pensions, or on the moratoria on auctions. We understand some of these may be particularly difficult, like the commitments made  the democratic electoral process, which we see as being fully recognized. And there is some room of flexible, but only if shortfalls in one domain are offset by ambitious delivery in others, which was the logic of the 20th_february agreement. Uh, let me raise just a few detailed points on some areas where differences exist. On fiscal and macro, we need to come to- common understanding. Realism in projections is needed, our starting point for discussion, cannot be one of no fiscal effort is needed in 2015, sufficient effort should be undertaken as needed over the medium run. We can consider a lower target for 2015 but there is still a gap to be closed and as , so should ambition. Second, on labor market reforms. The gap is still large in consultation with social partners  On privatization, our long-standing ambitious plan is now de facto stopped. Although the government has indicated it intends to continue with some projects this year. We need to have further details, which have not yet been provided and to propose change on the remaining uh, assets. Tentatively, based on this cursory information received, we believe that the plan needs more ambition and that the risk is that it falls significantly short of what is expected financially from privatization. This also I think will be a very important signal to investors. Uh, on financial stability there are growing concerns about banks’ balance sheets. Uh, let me stress once again that policy initiatives need to be concrete, they need to be time bound and mutually consistent. Previously agreed measures need to be respected, uh, the institutions are willing to consider what could be substituted with equitable measures in line with government priorities. Once again this is about the flexibility which has been recognized in the agreement of 20th_february. But some changes must be carefully calibrated and discussed openly. We also talked about  action. Rollback of measures and unilateral changes to policies and structural reforms are not expedient means of eventual progress. Policy initiative should be discussed ex ante, this principle must be respected mutually and the basis of work going forward. In this respect let me stress uh, our willingness to work and tackle authorities’ genuine concern on protecting the most vulnerable. But this needs to be done using targeted instrument directed at those who are most in need . We welcome, the recent decision to centralize cash dispersed to all entities of general government. While this may provide some breathing space for the next few days, this solution we all know, cannot last. So to conclude, I would say that time, as we all know, is of the essence. That time is now extremely limited. Delays come with the risk, even liquidity change,  together.",2015-04-24 00:00:00,European Commission

mario draghi,"Let me, first give you an update on the bank liquidity and . Renewed uncertainty about the discussions with the institutions on the conclusion of the review and on the ability to meet future debt obligations. Greek sovereign bond yields have reached the highest levels during this week since the debt restructuring in 2012. But there have been no significant contagion effects to other countries. At the same time the liquidity conditions of banks remain strained and fragile. We have seen accelerated deposit outflows since we last met, last time, on the back of increased uncertainty related to the discussions around the IMF Spring meetings. The adoption of the law on deposit transfers from the general government funds to the Bank of Greece and to a lesser extent the resolution of the small cooperative bank Panellinia. Due to the loss of deposits and other sources of financing the Greek banking system currently receives 111 billion euros of central bank liquidity, more than doubling last December’s reliance and the highest level as a share of GDP of any euro area country. On April 22, 2015, the governing council non objected to an increase the ELA ceiling of Euro 75.5 billion until and including 29th of April 2015 representing an increase of another 1.5 billion euro for the previous week. The ECB will continue extending liquidity to the Greek banks while there are solvent and they have sufficient collateral. However, we should be aware that the collateral of Greek banks is limited and that its value is decreasing when Greek government bond yields rise. Moreover, in light of recent developments in the increased risk of default of the Hellenic Republic, the governing council may need to assess the quality of the collateral used for ELA purposes including the applicable haircuts. So, the extreme fragile market and liquidity situation underlies the urgency of making progress in restoring confidence in the Greek economy. It’s absolutely essential that now decisive steps are taken to have agreement with the institutions and restore calm into the financial system. On the program itself, I entirely agree with the remarks made by Pierre Moscovici. On the- especially on the fiscal part of the program uh, it’s quite- it’s essential that agreement be reached on the macroeconomic projections, on the growth projections, so that a reasonable figure for the fiscal surplus can be agreed upon. And the second point where agreement is absolutely needed and its very, very urgent, is the series of structural reforms. Let me list some of them, because one of them is the independence of the HFSF, is of crucial importance for us. The reforms in product and services markets, again here much more determination is needed. The pension reforms, it’s kind of pointless to have pension laws that are fiscally unsustainable. The labor market reforms and uh, in general, in general the refraining from unilateral actions. So the outcome of this agreement should be a strong policy package that would produce growth while having a certain level of equity, respect in fiscal sustainability and financial stability. Thank you.",2015-04-24 00:00:00,ECB
jeroen dijsselbloem,"Thank you very much. Uh, Paul?",2015-04-24 00:00:00,EG President
poul mathias thomsen,"Thank you Jeroen. So, I agree with the remarks uh, made by Pierre and Mario. I agree that the discussions have been  good will and more open. I also want to be… make clear that we… there are… very vast differences we’re making in all key areas. I think there’s much progress in narrowing the differences that we take some of the major areas, one by one. Fiscal. On the fiscal, uh, we are in the situation where we don’t have final numbers for 2014, but it’s clear that rather than reaching the target of 1.5, we are probably at best, at balance. Because of backtracking of measures by the previous government, in the second half of last year. We might even have had a small deficit last year. Now, we have not, the new government has not presented us a revised budget for 2015. We have not been able to have that discussion, but it has said that it wants to backtrack in a number of areas. For instance, on pension reforms, the backtracking amounts, to…uh, if I include uh, the budget to pay a thirteenth pension, to almost 1% of GDP. What, what…On pensions, backtracking, yes. Backtracking on almost 1% of GDP, almost. Uh, altogether, I think that if we, uh, if we just take the proposals that have been put on the table, without the benefit of having seen a comprehensive budget proposal by the government, we think that you will have a deficit of 1-1.5% of GDP, this year, this year. Compared to a target of plus three, without measures. So we are facing a huge gap, a huge gap, between where we are going to come out without measures, um, and where we wanted to be, and we certainly agree that the 3% is not attainable anymore, that’s for sure. Uh, as the two others previous speakers said, there are major backtracking on on on pension reforms, on the fiscal structural reforms that are needed to get us to where we wanted to go over the next couple of years. Pension reforms, tax administration is moving in the wrong direction, and public administration reforms are moving, all three of them are moving in the wrong direction. Uh, so, so we, you know, we need to have that discussion, uh before we can even, uh discuss what is feasible and reasonable targets over the medium term. As others have said, labor market reforms are proposed to be reversed, although the government has not done so, yet. Product market reforms, there are some reversals there already, uh, but there is also a reluctance to go ahead with the framework that we had agreed, uh, for opening up of closed profession. Mario can comment on the financial sector. So throughout these important areas, there are major differences, and I think it’s important, I have to caution you what that would mean from our perspective, is that six months ago, we thought that Greece could go back to, possibly could go back to the market. And there would be no need for new money. With uh, with these, with these programs, with these proposals we have now, there will be a need for very, very significant new money. Secondly, until six months ago, we thought that there would be no need for debt relief. Under the November 2011 framework, agreed with the Eurogroup, we thought that these targets could… were basically achievable given where we were six months ago. If we aren’t uh… if we start deviating, in any notable way, from the existing program, be it primary target, be it privatization, be it the reforms underlying what already is very, very ambitious goals for some things. If that’s the case, we will be looking at the need for very significant debt relief, from Europe also, in order to ensure that this package is, package is sustainable. So, I think, you know, we need to keep this in mind, as we go forward. I do not want you to come back later and say that, that we sort of, jumped a surprise on you, in this regard. What should be done moving forward? Uh, I do think that the process needs to… still needs to improve. We’re still in a situation where our mission chiefs are not allowed to correlate the work in Athens. We’re still in a mission chiefs where our people sit in a hotel room and, , in Athens and not, can’t go to the ministries. It is not efficient. We .. err know, when we did this discussion in the previous four or five years, we always had the mission chiefs and discussions with ministers and their senior staff. Uh, policy level discussion with ministers and their senior staff. Then, it was another round of technical meeting and then more meetings with ministers. We had not one single time through the process with  where we had discussions with ministers. It’s not happened. So, uh, there is… it’s, the process needs to improve, uh, so that we can get into negotiations. We are not negotiating, at this stage. I, uh, and I think that is the diff–, also, for the, for the government to be able to move from what is still policies and objective, that are very, very broadly uh, defined and there are not anywhere close to specific action plans. Uh, so I, I think we need to…we need to discuss process also here, how to take it forward. Thank you.",2015-04-24 00:00:00,IMF
jeroen dijsselbloem,Thank you. Klaus?,2015-04-24 00:00:00,EG President
klaus regling,"Thank you. Thank you. Just two small points to add because there are not mentioned before. One is on the financial sector reform. The proposals that I see are more geared to protect um, indebted households and corporates. They are not here to strengthen the budget of banks and I think that could be a problem for us, given that HFSF money, 37 billion euro was given in the context of the program to strengthen the banking sector. So this could become a problem I think for all of us. The second point is, just as a reminder um, SMP downgraded um, Greece last week to triple-C and that means that now all the major rating agencies are on this triple-C territory which indicates a real probability of default. The readings are rating reports which are publicly available. It is clear that the rating agencies are following very closely the progress of the negotiations um, the liquidity situation and so on. Um, and the rating action, we need to remember will also have an impact on the liquidity of banks. Um, and the cost of funds for banks but also for corporates and  the borrowers, so it will be detrimental for the real economy. Thank you.",2015-04-24 00:00:00,ESM
jeroen dijsselbloem,"Thank you. Um, Thomas? Could you brief us on the discussion in the EWG?",2015-04-24 00:00:00,EG President
thomas wieser,"Thank you very much. We had a conference call last Wednesday  constructive. So I would describe it uh, by saying that the institutions have uh, agreed that the technical understanding of the disagreements has uh, improved. Therefore, on timing um, everybody is quite  results need to be produced very very soon. The next Eurogroup is on the 11 May, which essentially is two working weeks away from today. If we work backwards uh, that could imply that agreement between the Greek authorities, if one were to take that as a target which is not certain. But if one works backwards uh, the processes that we need in the euro-working group to prepare the Eurogroup etc. that would mean that agreement needs to be found within a week. Agreement means very specified documentation of course. So uh, the conclusion that I would draw is that something has to change possibly, in terms of the process because this is what ministers uh, expect uh, and their parliaments expect, is a very detailed, written technical document and not in a political narrative. So that is uh, the conclusion that I would draw from that talk uh, and where the separate items such as fiscal  institutions.",2015-04-24 00:00:00,EWG President

yanis varoufakis,"Thank you, Jeroen. It is our, uh, assessment that the deliberations with institutions have picked up of recent. We are, uh, pleased to report that, at least from our side, it seems as if, uh, a great deal of convergence has been achieved, even though it was not sufficient to reach an agreement, yet. But we are very optimistic and very positive, and wholly determined to make sure that, um, uh, we do our part so that the extra mile is covered within a short space of time. Let me, just briefly, um, mention some areas of agreement and disagreement. Just to give colleagues flair of the kind of progress that we have made, both us and the institutions. Let me begin with the example of tax administration. It was, um, um, part of the previous government’s, uh, commitment to the institutions that, uh, the tax authority, the General Secretariat of Public Revenues within my ministry, should be given greater autonomy. And I believe there was worry amongst colleagues, as well as the institutions that our government would want to claw some of this back, to roll it back. Well, I’m pleased to report that not only are we not doing this, but we now have consensus in the government to actually take it further than what the institutions ever asked for. We are, um, interested in and committed to now creating a fully independent tax authority. Independent both of political intervention, interference, but also corporate interference. And we’re keen to work with the institutions in order to create the- this kind of IRS-like, uh, separate entity that looks after public revenues. And as the minister of finance, I have to tell you, on a personal basis, that I’m very much looking forward not to have such control over public revenues. Also, uh, regarding the independence of authorities such as the Hellenic statistical authority ELSTAT, and the HFSF that Mario, uh, mentioned, I believe it was Mario and maybe Klaus, if memory serves. Uh, let me reiterate our government’s commitment to strengthen the independence of such, uh, bodies, uh, in full compliance with what the institutions and colleagues here around the table, uh, consider to be appropriate. On other issues, I- I just- I will not- I do not propose to go through, uh, very many of them, because this is something for us and the institutions to work out in the Brussels group and so on and so forth. But just- I ju- I just want to give you a flavor of the progress as we see it and the reason why we think that we are, uh, on the right path. Maybe we should be moving forward faster, but we are nevertheless on the right path. Uh, take the issue of VAT. There is a disagreement of sorts between us and the institutions regarding the emphasis. Our emphasis goes on collection. Let me give you a brief example. Last year on the famous islands of Mykonos and Santorini, we had tourism, economic activity, tourist activity doubled, and yet disgracefully, absolutely disgracefully, VAT collection went down by 30%. This has nothing to do with the rate of VAT. That has to do with the failure of our tax authorities to collect it. So we put more emphasis on- on collection- on the collectability. The institutions put more emphasis on harmonization and looking at different rates, but I have no doubt that in good faith we can work this out, we can hammer out an agreement on this, uh, which I will not now bother you with as to how exactly it will be- it will manifest itself. On the question of privatizations, I heard Pierre, uh, mention that and- and- and- and Paul mention that there’s been backtracking. I don’t believe that backtracking or rolling back is apt as a description of what we’re doing. After a few weeks of deliberating as a new government, we have now come to a very clear position on this. We are continuing with the privatization drive, only we are resetting the parameters in a way that I think that colleagues, if I was given an opportunity to explain, my se – my hunch is colleagues would agree with what we’re saying. What we’re saying is that privatizations must happen in a way that, um, removes them from the realm of fire sales, which is what we’ve had in the past few years. So, it is not that we are slowing down privatizations, it is that we want to put greater emphasis not on the sale price, but on things like minimum investment provisions by the bidders. We want the state to retain an equity, like it happens in many other European countries around this table. We want to have-uh, in case of regional airports, let’s say for example, we would like greater commitment and planning for an integration of, uh, the new activities in these privatized facilities, with the local economies. So, our purpose is to remove the emphasis or to shift the emphasis away from the, uh, just, you know, the- the asking price or the bidding price and placing it- shifting it towards greater developmental, uh, um, impact and the multiplied accelerated- accelerated effects that these will have. Shifting on very quickly to the question of labor markets. Now, this is where we may agree to disagree with Paul and maybe some others. We believe that, uh, a labor market like Greece’s is not just excessively deregulated as it is, in practice, not so much in law but in practice. But it is a labor market that should all make us particularly worried regarding the degree of informality. When you have a labor market, which has shrunk significantly due to the recession and on top of that, more than 30% of paid labor is informal undeclared labor, one realizes that standard arguments about deregulation fail to connect with the reality on the ground. So, when we talk about, for instance, a role for collective bargaining, that is not simply a return to what we had before, this is not what we plan to do, but a kind of smart collective bargaining framework, um, not different to the one we have in Germany or in other European countries, uh, hammered out and designed together in association with the International Labor Organization for instance, uh, would help bring about a large number of workers into the formal sector again and therefore strengthen the pension system and strengthen our tax state. Uh, non-performing loans is a major issue. It keeps the credit circuits from functioning properly. It keeps our export-oriented companies from being able to fulfill orders and to finalize their transactions with, uh, their customers abroad as a result of the failure to secure letters of credit from the banking sector. These are all issues that we’re discussing with the institutions. These are all issues that we want to settle. And which I think we’re making considerable progress in finding common ground with the institutions. But be- uh, let me finish with a couple of, uh, points. All this, as Pierre very succinctly said, has to be, and I’m sure that Mario and Paul too would agree with, has to be embedded in a dynamically consistent fiscal plan, a dynamically consistent debt sustainability analysis. We are undogmatic about this. We don’t have any fixation about what the primary surplus should be. What we’re concerned about is the method, the method that has been, uh, utilized so far of saying, okay, in 2020, we want a particular debt to GDP ratio, let’s say 120% and now let’s work backwards, and their assumptions about, regarding the growth rate of, let’s say, 3% on average, what the primary surplus must be in 2019, ’18, ’17, all the way to today. And then we end up with a primary surplus, which in our estimation is not consistent with a growth rate, which is implicit, the assumption, for working out this kind of path. So this is a kind of consolidation trap that we want to avoid. And we want to discuss it with the institutions, the DSA, that actually makes dynamically consistent sense. And this is an area of disagreement so far, but this government is absolutely committed to signing on the dotted line of a fiscal plan that makes sense, to us, and which we can fully commit to. Unlike previous governments, you -you will allow me to say, we are not prepared, prepared to make pledges just in order to unl- unlock liquidity that we do not believe are possible to attain. And I hope that the- our partners, the institutions, everyone around this table takes this in good faith and recognizes that this is a government that wants to make pledges that it can fulfill. Finally, on the question of liquidity, I’m very much afraid that we are talking about very few days- week, less than two weeks before we have a serious, uh, chance of an accident. And it is our considered opinion that it will be a shame that these negotiations, which in our estimation, are proceeding along the lines that all of us want and which may very easily, uh, in the next few days or weeks, attain an agreement that is mutually beneficial to everyone, uh, be derailed by a liquidity, uh, sourced failure. Uh, we believe that sufficient progress has been made. And we are determined to put on, uh, to demonstrate constantly our utter commitment to making this negotiation bear fruit, so as to enable the Eurogroup very shortly, even possibly through a teleconference, to make the statement which is necessary in order to create conditions for, uh, relaxing the liquidity constraint. I shall close Jeroen by saying that I understand the view that only major pressure can progress be made and that includes liquidity pressure. But let me also say that too much pressure, too much duress may cause, can cause a breakdown of a negotiation perfectly capable of yielding a successful agreement. So I urge colleagues to help prevent this by creating a roadmap, both for the institutions and for the Greek authorities for what follows over the next few days and weeks. Thank you very much.",2015-04-24 00:00:00,Greece

peter kažimír,"Thank you. Unbelievable. This is my feeling, what I heard just now. Okay, formally I would like to start with this that, I would like to thank, I think all we should thank to the institutions and the ESM for their work both in Brussels and in Athens. Uh, it’s true that that our Greek partners have finally started to open up in the talks but honestly we need a quantum leap forward than where it is now. Uh, we have agreed in February to have a comprehensive list of reforms by end of April. We don’t have it. Instead, we saw reluctance to corporate, backtracking on some measures adopted before elections and fiscal sustainability is volatile. Uh, personally though last month I refused to the union of pensioners in my country. I refused a proposal of a 13th pension introduction in my country. Why? Because medium term objective, fiscal responsibility, fiscal consolidation in my country. You can pay out additional pension to your pensioners if you have money enough. Do we have money enough? I cannot support any agreement with you and at the same time refuse the 13th pension in my country and to just observe 13th pension in your country. And this is backtracking of a measure that, which is, we regret in different ways. So we talk but substance is still missing and so, on this question is if we are still on track to meet our June deadline, this I think is the only question for us. And okay we are ready to help Greece but if Greece doesn’t want our help and conditions accompany maybe the time has come to talk consequences. Thank you.",2015-04-24 00:00:00,Slovakia

jeroen dijsselbloem,"Our colleagues, let me try and draw a conclusion possibly that is going back to what we agreed on the 20th and 24th of February where we were quite clear that the program could be, would allow for some flexibility if it would remain within the key targets of the program. In other words the program had to stay on track. We are now very close to the end of April and my understanding from the institutions even though Yanis is a little more optimistic is that very very little progress has been made. Um, I don’t think it’s useful to set new deadlines. I think we have to hold the energy in uh, to work on an agreement as soon as possible within, fully within the agreement we had, the statement of the 20th_february, Having said that I think the way the process is going so far we cannot continue. So I will talk with the institutions and with the Greek governments on how to redesign the program. It has been fragmented, it has been inefficient, and the institutions have simply made it clear to us just now that the work cannot be done and an agreement will not be reached if we continue this way. So the process has to be redesigned to pick up the pace. On substance, I think we have uh, a reasonably clear picture of what the key issues are. Um, I feel that uh, it’s going to be difficult to reach an agreement but I also feel that we have to. Uh, and I think that hard work will have to be put in. I will not be optimistic about reaching an agreement before the next Eurogroup so therefore, I will refrain from talking about new deadlines or aiming for an agreement before the next meeting, because as Wieser said we would need an agreement, on a technical level within a week and where we are now I don’t think that is reasonable unless miracles happen. So uh, after the meeting I think it’s important that with the institutions and the Greek government we talk about redesigning the process to get it at a higher level and a higher pace. Um, that is ",2015-04-24 00:00:00,EG President

I think  solution.",2015-04-24 00:00:00,Germany
jeroen dijsselbloem,"Um, on process what has happened and this was a concession to the Greek government, we have uh changed the process which traditionally takes place with the troika institutions going to a capital and working there in a very concerted and concentrated manner with the authorities in the ministries with ministers uh, and on request from the Greek government we have had a fragment process with some talks going on in Brussels, some work being done in Athens, very difficult, little access certainly in the beginning and I think that it is key to go back to a very comprehensive approach uh, allowing access in Athens. And having the main talks in Athens without the distinction we’ve tried to make so far on request of the Greek government between negotiations and technical work. This has to be brought together uh, the only way we can get this process going. Um, I think we still should put in, all of us, the effort that we can to find this agreement. It will take a lot of steps from the Greek government, absolutely no doubts about that and whether they are willing and able to do so is to be tested within the next days and weeks, as time is running out.

hans jörg schelling," how should we solve this problem? If it necessary to make a new set up to bring it to progress, then it’s ok. But uh, we lost so much time in the last weeks and months that I cannot believe that it is possible with changing the set ups. If it is possible to change the set up, with changing the set ups does it make progress or a solution? And uh, as I told in an interview, that we cannot make a decision because we have not the right information. We have no documents. Uh, you called me a liar, so I have to present this in an Austrian newspaper so this is not a problem for me uh, to make this discussion about fact. We don’t know exactly what is the financial situation of Greece, we don’t know uh, which part of the list of report should be canceled or continued. What is the time starting with this report and uh, therefore it’s, in my opinion, not possible to follow this set up and this way which we have, since maybe half a year. So please can you tell us what you plan to bring in the next 2, 3, 4 or 5 days to reach that what Thomas said, to bring up uh, a statement which is necessary for the next discussions on the political level in between the next week.

pierre moscovici,"Thank you Jeroen. Um, first of all I’d like to say from the outset that uh from our side we would really like to be able to do everything that we find a solution uh, with Greece. A positive one. But I am very worried from the way the discussion goes today uh, I have carefully listened to the three institutions and they have listed all the problems that are still there, they are not new and that are not being solved. And I’ve heard our Greek partner Yanis telling us what he told us ,but apart from the issues that deal with the collecting taxes, which we all would welcome I’m sure, I haven’t heard not a single point where I felt that uh, he was ready to move in the direction that we are expecting. And as Wolfgang Schäuble said correctly, I also think we are moving in the wrong direction instead of moving in the right direction. And I’m very worried about that. Um, on top of it its really unfortunate that there seems to be roll back on certain measures. I say it seems because it’s very difficult for us in a distance to really appreciate the situation in some cases and on some issues and that’s obviously contrary to our 20th_february agreement. Now if that is so, I’m afraid that it’s not enough Jeroen, although I support your proposal, it is not enough to change the way we do the negotiation. It’s obviously unfortunate that there is no contact at political level and at administerial level but that alone will not do it. And I am very worried of what we’re going to say when we walk out of this room if we just say that we changed the procedure because then it’s the credibility of the whole negotiation that is put into question. And the credibility of the whole Eurozone. And last but not least, I think we have a time issue. The liquidity problems of Greece are going to happen in the next two weeks as far as I understand, and to find a global agreement in our framework will take more than two weeks uh, for sure because we have not yet received the detailed plan from our Greek friend. And even if we were to receive it in the next couple of days, I understand that it would take much more time to find eventually an agreement on it. So I think we have here a timing issue that we have to re-discuss it together. So I’m afraid I’m not offering a lot of solutions but I’m asking quite a few questions, but I think the credibility of the process needs to be really looked at.",2015-04-24 00:00:00,European Commission

Uh, and I think that’s when we have to face a situation with such a gap, I think that it is truly important to handle expectations and communication. So I think that uh, well I fully agree with you that to set new deadlines perhaps is not wise, but I think that we need something to say, in our communication. I don’t know if you have prepared some messages because well, we are running out of time. We have a very short period of time and I think that we have to try to do our utmost.

And uh, its  according to my assessment it’s not the problem of liquidity, it’s the problem of solvency of Greece and there’s no plan how to make Greece solvent again. It’s no way that I can persuade Slovenians, which are the most exposed to Greece, that they would put additional effort into helping Greece getting out of this situation. So actually I think we should talk about plan B here, we had so many months, two months to solve a question. With a few days now, a few weeks, I don’t see how we can get there.

pier carlo padoan,"Thanks Jeroen. Actually Michel anticipated many of the things I wanted to say so very briefly let me just stress a few points. I just I have one point only and the point is let’s not fool ourselves. Let’s not try to pretend that nothing is happening. Here the framework which was agreed in February is simply collapsing. Uh, the framework we had agreed in February was that Greece needed to have a short term, few months, effort which was categorised under the extended program because this was needed for its own sake. But this was also needed to move to the next stage where the deeper structural issues that Greece has to face would be tackled with a medium term approach. Now we are risking to fail on both fronts. Uh, we hear that time is short. Liquidity is running out in spite of the huge amount of liquidity that, as Mario just reminded us, was given to the country. In proportions that are unprecedented in the Euro zone. So that amount of liquidity tells a lot about the time that has been lost. So I am deeply frustrated by the fact that we are facing a situation which is very difficult to communicate by. Let’s not fool ourselves without  this is not understood. Unless we dramatically change gear both in process and in content. It’s not about completing the reform program in two weeks. It’s about saying that this is a fresh start about issues that have to deal, first of all with the welfare of the Greek people. But then also with the obvious fact, obvious to me at least, that you need at the same time build a structural reform program which boosts growth and enhances welfare and consistency with  figures in terms of fiscal and monetary. Otherwise, it doesn’t work. Let’s not fool ourselves. So this is just to share my frustration and I apologize to colleagues about this. But we are not, we do not have the luxury of st- we are losing time.",2015-04-24 00:00:00,Italy

jeroen dijsselbloem,Okay. Rimantas?,2015-04-24 00:00:00,EG President
rimantas šadžius,"Could I remind you that we started in February I think from discussing three trajectories of Pierre’s Moscovici and I was the one that – who said that, well the most likely trajectory is the third one, things go as they go, without any progress. Until now we see this. Uh, to find out the way uh, out of the situation, I think we also should recall the first message that was um, said by Michel Sapin, I also recall this in February. The first principle  that we should respect the will of Greek people. I think today we have a full ground of changing this attitude. I should tell you that Lithuanian people that I’m representing didn’t vote for the present majority in the Greek parliament. We even had no chance to say any argument during the election campaign so from this point of view uh, we have no obligation to support the measures that were proposed or given as promises uh, to the Greek people. And I think uh, that we have a full right in Lithuania to look critically at these proposals. Uh since Paul has said that uh, well um, a huge financial assistance is looming some time in the future, I think uh, for negotiating this huge financial assistance, I also will have to explain the measures that have been taken, or have been planned or have been realised or not, uh in Greece. And here I recall first the example that was given by Peter, the 13th pension that would amount to 1 percent of GDP, this assessment of IMF, uh if I recall uh, correctly in Lithuania we have overall 12 pensions of 8 percent of GDP. Which means that the pension system of Greece is unsustainable. Simply it is unsustainable. The second example, the second problem that was uh, widely discussed around this table was uh, the question of minimum wage. It was hidden somehow where I think they haven’t yet made the decisions uh, but still discussing it. To my mind and to mind of many people that I talk around in Lithuania, it would be crazy to increase to that extent the minimum wage when you have uh, 30 percent of uh, unemployment plus 30 percent of gray employment in your country as was said by Yanis. Um these two measures are the most evident things, the most evident points for discussion in the Lithuanian society if uh, further assistance to Greece from ESM would be discussed. People don’t know what the structural balance is, what the private , quite recently and now everyone in Lithuania compares how much we earn compared to other countries. Um, the situation that we do have in Greece now tells me that this country lives not by its means. And what is happening now, I would not call this tragedy. Uh, the lack of liquidity. I would call this natural economic adjustment. So this third trajectory uh, to-to it could be sustainable. This is also Lithuanian experience. We have the same situation in 2009 where we lost one-third of taxation income quite immediately after the uh, financial crisis started. We managed somehow to pay what we had to pay from our resources, then the necessary indispensable decisions, our own sovereign decisions were to cut expenses. We did this. We did this not very simply, now we have some decisions in the constitutional court. We managed to construct a quite complicated legal mechanisms of compensating people in the future which is always the case, which is always the possibility. Another possibility I think for those couple of thousands, which is many, civil servants that Greek authorities consider, that were fired not justly. I think this could solve the problem in the future. But all these decisions, all these decisions should be taken by Greek authorities. But here I think uh, the sovereignty of this country, it should be respected but we, the rest of the Eurozone, we also have a say. We also have a say because what is happening there affects our countries uh and there is no democratic counterbalance for that. Because in a single separate country, if the government behaves not the way it should, uh, there is always people who can elect another government. We have no such possibility, but I think we have a possibility and we should use this possibility today to tell our Greek friends that we care of- very much about. We wish the best success for them, but we can and we should give an advice for them: to undertake measures uh, are absolutely necessary. Of course they will be living for some time, I would uh, I can see this as quite, quite a long time, they will live on their own because uh, I can’t see any possibility to conclude the agreement very soon. But I would strongly uh, agree with proposal of Jeroen. That first, that we should say okay enough is enough. First, we change the mode of discussions. And uh, we should make the proposal for the Greek authorities on behalf of the rest of the Eurogroup to behave differently and to consider very seriously uh, the steps forward. Um, if we get this first result in terms of procedure, this could show us the sign of hope to get real results in discussing the program. Um, as a precondition for getting the final economic financial agreement with Greek authorities. But, uh, on the other hand, our advice would be uh, for Greece to start living on their own. To start not relying on external assistance all the way along and uh, then we shall see what can be undertaken solidly by all the Eurozone countries to improve the situation. But the basics should be done uh, by our Greek friends. And this is our friendly pressure. Please consider this as our friendly pressure. Thank you.",2015-04-24 00:00:00,Lithuania

Why do we still have confidence in it? Why would we still be prepared to continue supporting Greece? And we all want to because the Eurozone, working together in Eurozone is to all of us very important. You have to realize that there have to be results in the short term because the process is coming to an end. I think that’s a signal that all our colleagues are giving you.",2015-04-24 00:00:00,EG President
yanis varoufakis,"Thank you, Jeroen. I appreciate the difficulties that each one of us faces when we go back home to explain the present circumstances. I was struck by a certain disconnect between the atmosphere as I understand it in the negotiations, the Brussels group in Athens. Between our authorities and the institutions and a certain degree of hostility which I encountered here today. Hostility which I hope is going to simply dissipate and disappear very soon. I accept my Lithuanian friend’s friendly pressure, I do believe that we need to be pressurized. But I believe that all of us need to be pressurized into coming to a comple—a final conclusion to this saga. Let me reassure all colleagues that this government is not going to contemplate even being dragged into the indignity of primary deficits again. We will do whatever it takes, we will introduce whatever measures it takes, in order to ensure that we do not sink into primary deficit. Let me also remind you colleagues that Greece is not a country that has been idling around over the last five years doing nothing in order to help itself and to deal with its major problems. We are the champions of fiscal consolidation in the era of peace time. Our reduction of structural deficit has been monumental. Of course there were many social costs and economic costs as you all know. I don’t need to go into this again, but just hearing the various views around this table today someone who doesn’t know the history of the last five years will be mistaken into thinking that Greece has been sitting on its hands doing nothing. There has been wasted time since the 20th_february and 24th of February Eurogroup agreement. Our idea of how to implement that agreement, and it was one as Jeroen knows well, that we tried to communicate, was very simple. What we needed as a Eurogroup, as the institutions, as we the Greek authorities was to complete essentially a review very quickly, in a few weeks, couple of months at the most, a review what failed to be concluded by the previous government in a much longer space of time, and under very difficult circumstances. Let me remind you colleagues that we were elected after a bank run had already begun, speaking of liquidity. Our idea was that we should agree on a sustainable dynamically consistent fiscal plan and four or five major reform bills that could be pushed through parliament by now or by May. So as to show some action to our peoples, the Greek people, the Lithuanian people, the Slovak people. Everyone. Instead, we embarked upon, and I understand the reasons, there are institutional reasons for that, a full and comprehensive review. Time and again, the Greek government attempted to table very specific policy proposals. But time and again, we were told that this must await the complete and comprehensive review. So my Austrian friend will permit me to say, that it is not true that we did not table proposals. Some of them were actually, against our will, leaked to Financial Times. Another colleague spoke of a deja vu. We have that sensation too. The idea now of returning to the failed process of the troika where technocrats visit ministries and discuss with ministers. That was a model that was utilized in the past which made the Greek population, independently of what we may want as ministers or as the cabinet, made the Greek population very hostile to this process and this is why we agreed on the Brussels group and Athens group um, dual mechanism. I believe that the Commission, from what I hear from them, was very much in support of this mechanism. I do also believe that it is right that in the European Union ministers should be negotiating with ministers and not be interrogated by technocrats. I believed that we had settled this. As far as the efficiency of the process is concerned, I shall come back to this in one second. I won’t be long Jeroen. I just want to mention a couple of points. Firstly to my Slovak colleague, I understand your point about your pensioners but let me tell you that the direction of change matters perhaps matters more than the absolute level. It is one thing to deny pensioners pension rights, it’s quite another to have had what we have had, a sequence of pay reductions. Similarly, with a minimum wage, we would never imagine of increasing the minimum wage now if it hadn’t been reduced to the extent it has. But even that we have put on the back burner. We are prepared to leave this in abeyance until we negotiate. On the question of liquidity, a colleague mentioned that, suggested or opined that the liquidity problem we have is a natural economic adjustment. Let me beg to differ colleagues. The Greek state lives within its means. Has been doing so for a year now. We have a small but nevertheless positive primary surplus. The liquidity problem that we are facing is not due to the fact that we are over–living beyond our means, it is due to the fact that we are in a program which has certain redemptions, repayments particular to the IMF during these months, that have been scheduled. And certain scheduled disbursements which of course have been suspended for reasons that you all know. We have been meeting those repayments out of the flesh and blood of our own state’s liquidity. This is why we have a liquidity difficulty at the moment. We have been meeting, we’ve been scraping the bottom of the barrel of our state’s resources in order to be meeting repayments to the IMF and to other creditors which were meant, according to the program, to the previous program, to the existing program, call it what you might, were meant to be covered by disbursements. If you annualise the repayments that my ministry has made to creditors over the last two months, you will come to an astounding sum of 14.2 percent of GDP having come out of the fabric of the Greek state to meet those repayments. But without, simply because I do not want to carry on along those lines and burden you further, let me say that we can make this work. That Plan B should not be mentioned. It is highly and immoderately anti-European even to bring about this discussion. My dear colleague from Slovenia should know that it is not in the interest of his citizens that we even discuss this at the moment. I reject such a discussion, our government intends to do what it takes in order to remain within the Eurozone, it is a discussion that we are not accepting to have as a matter of principle and as a matter of commitment to the benefits and to the interests of the average European. We can move very quickly along the lines that were already suggested. Let’s agree on a dynamically sustainable fiscal plan, four or five bills that can be introduced in the next few weeks and move on. Thank you, colleagues.",2015-04-24 00:00:00,Greece
jeroen dijsselbloem,"Um, colleagues I’m not going to open the floor for a second round, if you would agree. Uh, I want to ask Yanis basically three things, I would like him to respond positively, uh, to give us, uh, some perspective of the process in the next days and weeks. First of all, I think we can all reconfirm that the agreements of the 20th_february and the 24th are still the framework  there is absolutely no deviation from that. It also, means, for example, we still  that one aspect of backtracking on a number of measures, can and will be done, uh, because they have to be tested on economic principle, et cetera, by the institutions as agreed on 20th_february. So, that’s point one. Point two is, uh, I would like a confirmation from Yanis that the Greek government is open to redesign the process because the way that things are going now, fragmented in different places, uh, the tremendous struggle to even get data, et cetera, has to stop. And we can talk details, uh, outside of this meeting, but we need a certain and comprehensive approach to the process. Uh, thirdly, I’m worried about what you say about the fiscal plan and the number of, a couple of reforms. We agreed from the beginning, and this is crucial to all of us, that there has to be a comprehensive deal on what should be put in place in these four months till the end of June, to have a chance of a positive conclusion with a comprehensive package, not just a couple of reforms. I want to make sure that there is no misunderstanding there, because otherwise, we’re trying to get to different points. All of us are trying to work towards a comprehensive deal and you are talking about a fiscal plan and some reforms. So please, can you respond on the three issues I raised.",2015-04-24 00:00:00,EG President
yanis varoufakis,"I take it, do you want me to respond now? On the question of process, we are quite happy to discuss a revamping of the process in a way that makes, uh, the convergence more likely, but I must insist that the old ways of the troika visits in Athens, uh, have had their day. At least that is what I believe my mandate is from my prime minister and from the Greek government. I also believe that this was the view of the European Commission and maybe we can be enlightened on this. Secondly, on the question of, uh, backtracking, we are committed, during the negotiation not to make any moves that will jeopardize the negotiation. Our understanding of backtracking may be, of roll, uh, back or of rollback as it’s also called me be quite different. We don’t believe, for instance, that canceling pension reductions, very rapid pension de- reductions in the middle of this crisis as we speak constitutes any kind of rollback, but we are not going to move on until the negotiation has, uh, been completed, we will respect the process. Um, and the final question was?",2015-04-24 00:00:00,Greece

yanis varoufakis,"Of course. By the way, I didn’t say “couple”, I said four or five reforms bills that go through parliament. Um, Jeroen, we are thoroughly undogmatic on this too, we’re very happy to go along with the comprehensiveness of the review but in order to unlock the deadlock, as an interim suggestion, we are not insisting on this, it is just a suggestion. I’m sure that the institutions and most of our colleagues here would agree that there are a number of reforms that are urgently needed in Greece and I think we can agree on what these are, we have a common ground of this. Why not, while the comprehensive review is continuing, agree on three, four, five such reform bills that can be pushed through parliament in complete agreement with the institutions while the comprehensive review is proceeding so as to expedite the process that would lead to the conclusion of the comprehensive review? Now, if colleagues are not, uh, enthused by this suggestion… Um, as I said, this is not an insistence, it’s a suggestion, the purpose of which is to open up possibilities.",2015-04-24 00:00:00,Greece
jeroen dijsselbloem,"I’m sorry, um, um, but listening to you on all three issues, uh, I don’t think we’re there. We have, uh, maybe a misunderstanding, uh, maybe we simply disagree but there is not enough grounds, uh, on three issues. First of all, there cannot be a different understanding of what backtracking is. So I think it has to be agreed that there will be no reversal of measures or new measures already put in place which, uh, damage the fiscal position, which damage the economic indicators in the financial sector or the financial stability in the financial sector. There has to be clarity on that. Secondly, yes, we do have to revisit how we designed, uh, the process, uh, and you will have to be undogmatic on that also. I’m not going to accept that we go out this room, you saying, “ah, well, we think, uh, we don’t want to do it the way it was”. The way it has been done in the past has proved to be quite effective, and the way we’re doing it now is not effective at all. So, uh, I will need also, uh, an undogm- undogmatic approach there. And thirdly, um, all the approach of the comprehensiveness, you have again and again said, uh, and needed for a part deal, let’s do something first. And again and again, we’ve said, we need to have an agreement on the comprehensiveness on the whole issue. So we know what we can expect from each other over this, this period of extension. So, um, please, I need a little more responsiveness on what we’re saying here.",2015-04-24 00:00:00,EG President
yanis varoufakis,"On the comprehensiveness issue, as I said, it is a mere suggestion. If, uh, colleagues believe that we should put everything in abeyance until the whole process is complete, we will go along with that. On the question of backtracking, we’re quite happy to accept that until the negotiation converges to a complete agreement, there will be no backtracking as you defined it. We have a different view of what a rollback means, but that is simply at the realm of interpretation. On the question of the process, I want you to clarify something for me. Are you putting it to me that it is incumbent upon the Greek government to accept the return to the original troika process as it was being, uh, implemented and as it unfolded prior to our election?",2015-04-24 00:00:00,Greece
jeroen dijsselbloem,"What I want is, uh, for the process which is now fragmented on different tables and different places in the next couple of weeks to come together in a comprehensive mode, and that’s the only way we can get it done. I’m absolutely convinced. Uh, the details we can discuss outside this meeting with the institutions who have a role,  you and I, on how to get it done. Uh, I am absolutely sure the way we’ve done it so far, uh, which we took into account your objections to the old way, that the way that we’ve tried it the last couple of months does not deliver. And also, it has to do, of course, as many of the colleagues have said with political substance, but I’m convinced that it also has to do with way, the way we design this process.",2015-04-24 00:00:00,EG President

If the liquidity situation is as worrisome as you, uh, indicated and, uh, if we are at the process where we are, it’s going to be a hell of a job to bring those two together before it goes wrong. And therefore I need from the Greek side, uh, to do whatever it takes in terms of process to, to get, to get out of that squeeze, it is the only thing I’m asking.

Find a balance on the other side and not creating a crisis atmosphere outside this room but we are very worried among ourselves, we’ve made that very explicit. I don’t think it’s helpful for the Eurozone and certainly not for Greece if we create a crisis atmosphere after this meeting. But I will in my press statements express the concern that we have over the progress being made, the situation in Greece as time moves on and the highly needed progress, the sense of urgency that we all felt. Um, along those lines I will communicate uh, and I would ask you to do the same. Over to your thoughts and reactions. ",2015-04-24 00:00:00,EG President
yanis varoufakis,"Jeroen might I? I just wanted to ask you that besides uh, expressing concern which of course we all share, whether you’re willing or planning to express that, as we heard at least from the institutions uh, that progress has been registered in the discussion so far between the Greek authorities and the institutions.",2015-04-24 00:00:00,Greece
jeroen dijsselbloem,"We have to distinguish that over the last couple of months, there has been very little progress, some have even said there has been more moving backwards than moving forward. Yet, I also recognize that the last couple of days or this week I’ve heard some more positive things. So with that distinguishment uh, I can work, but two months is a long time. Uh and that time has overall been lost. So you’re right, the last couple of days, at least I heard, some more positive signals of constructiveness, moving forward on a couple of issues but the general picture is still two months lost. So there also there’s a balance. Um I think we will stop here colleagues and all of us will have to do as much as we can to manage the situation to get progress  the Greek side. Um, we will continue in two minutes. ",2015-04-24 00:00:00,EG President
pierre moscovici,"… closely and they’re supposed to conclude the package by June. On the statistics, let me draw your attention to the commitment to a man you know modified dependence of endemic statistics Institute as a start. A draft decision is now being discussed, involvement of experts from Eurostat. Uh, so there are really welcome progress. Despite this progress, uh, we are not yet, as I said, close to reaching the staff level agreement. Let me highlight some key areas where further work, uh, remains to be done. First, we are to agree, uh, yet on fiscal package for 2015 and 2016 and critical measures to fill, uh, substantial gaps. We need to see a couple of large, uh, parametric reforms that deliver, a, a key a yield to some ’15 and ’16. Uh, authorities have brought in the idea of an important reform of the, uh, VAT rating system, uh, exemption to be restricted to goods and services to the mentally consumed by low income outsource. Uh, this would be, uh, more than promising move, uh, but we must move, uh, this idea from an option under discussion to clear a quantifiable proposal that delivers a, a, a large net fiscal growth. We also need  consolidation that is expenditure based and not only revenue based. Uh, potential reform can contribute. We offer our support to help design reforms that ensure sustainability correspond and strengthens incentives to work. Uh, on the privatization program, uh, several tenders have not gone, uh, ahead, implying scale-back. This is somehow disappointing, uh, uh, as it can generate significant lower proceeds than foreseen. Uh, talks of , uh, are key for the overall, uh, make recommend scenario and should continue in the coming days, uh, to produce a robust list of actions. On a product market reforms, uh, more work needs to be done. Uh, on a welcome positive note, we seem to be converging of measures to open up gas markets and strengthen the energy regulator. But plans to rethink reforms in the electricity sector may need to be further strengthened. Labor markets globally remain an area of concern. Uh, we share the goals of the modern, uh, system of collective bargaining and to reflect social demands in this difficult period. But we, uh, should steer clear of any return to the fraud practices of the past. And similarly, proposals of minimum wages should reflect current market conditions with an unemployment rate, which is still at 25%. Uh, Greece needs modern, uh, labor market institutions to provide a better employment opportunity. Finally, uh, allow me to, to stress Commission support, uh, for measures to alleviate the , uh, impact of the economic crisis and to help Greece, uh, build permanent, uh, getting social safety nets. Uh, the approach is to target root problems under , uh, targeted instruments, measures that directs resources, uh, uh, those most i-in need. Uh, general approaches, uh, will not suffice and uh, will not bring the results we all, uh, seek. We can work together and affordable schemes that provide immediate support, uh, in the near term. So, and one last word about next steps. Uh, overall, uh, we can say, uh, we will, uh, commit to any statement that goes into that direction of course. Uh, we can say that there has been good progress on the process and, uh, promising at scoring in a number of areas. However, uh, continual work, uh, must still be done to secure a credible blanket that meets the approach we agreed on, uh, the 21st … the 20th_february. Uh, I therefore, uh, call upon Greek authorities to redouble their efforts, uh, and work intensively in the Brussels  in the coming days. We have to have an agreement as soon as possible, not only, uh, so that Greece can meet its obligations, but also because it procedures to make a program disbursement outcomes and take at least four weeks to complete. We’ve got their parliamentary, uh, approvals that need to be met. Once, uh, its review has been, uh, successfully concluded, then we can proceed . Uh, the outcome automatically depends on, on political will and commitment, uh, from both sides. So from the legal parties, uh, and the Commission stands ready and to fully engage with the Greek authorities alongside institutions, you, as it is done in past weeks. Uh, that’s our impressions and, and comments. Merci Pierre. Um, Benoit?",2015-05-11 00:00:00,European Commission
benoît cœuré,"Thank you for your management of Alexander  framework. So there is still much, much to learn from it and from him. Um, moving to Greece, um, let me say a few words on the, uh, market, uh, and uh, banks liquidity situation. Um, markets are certainly waiting for the outcome of today’s, uh, meeting. Um, the, um, higher volatility recently displayed by Greek  Eurogroup, just to give you a measure of the, uh, nervousness of financial markets. Uh, the liquidity condition of banks remain extremely strained and fragile. Um, deposit outflows have accelerated, uh, following, uh, the last Eurogroup meeting, uh, on the 24th of April. This influx reflects the decree on cash pulling of, uh, government of public sector deposits, uh, which is in itself not an unwelcome development. It’s just a mechanical consequence of, uh, public sector entities withdrawing money from their bank account, which is fine. And, uh, and uh, consistent with the, uh, uh, general objective of ensuring the solvency of the state. But it also reflects, uh, deposit uncertainty. Uh, currently is a Greek banking system receives 114, 1-1-4, billion of central bank liquidity, which is 64% of Greek GDP and by far the highest of any, uh, euro zone country. Uh, liquidity will continue to be extended by the, uh, Central Bank of Greece, uh, as long as Greek banks are solvents, uh, and have, uh, sufficient collateral, uh, and as long as, uh, this liquidity extension, uh, does not constitute monetary dependence of the government. Uh, however we should be aware that collateral is limited, uh, and that the value decreases when, uh, Greek government bonds raise. Uh,  purpose, uh, including the applicable haircuts. Um, these had been discussed in the governing council last week, uh, and the governing councils closely, uh, monitoring the situation. So the bottom line here is a financial situation of banks is, uh, increasingly fragile, uh, and it’s crucial that we see next steps, uh, to come to an agreement, uh, to help restore market confidence and, and deposit of confidence. So in this perspective, we welcome very much the confirmation by the government that the, uh, uh, payment to the IMF tomorrow, uh, will be made. Uh, and let me just, uh, uh, let me just, uh, uh, comment that, uh, any, uh, um … That the government not, uh, uh, meeting an international commitment would have a, uh, severe and po-potentially devastating, uh, impact on the, on the  harm Greek economy. Um, on the um, review. Uh, and just, uh, to follow up on what Pierre has said, on the process, we also welcome, uh, the, uh, notable improvement in the discussions in the, uh, in the Brussels group. Um, still the process is far from optimal. Uh, logistic, logistical constraints have slowed down progress. Uh, direct discussions with relevant ministers, uh, would have been desirable. And this is not only a question of efficiency, but also a question of ownership by the, uh, various ministers. So it’s crucial, uh, that the Brussels group discussions has a backing from the entire, uh, government. Turning to substance, uh, we’ve seen progress in, now in some of the existing policy differences, uh, that relates to the macro economic collections for ’15 and ’16 as Pierre has said, had said, uh, where it should not be too difficult to agree on the common deadline. Uh, also, the authorities have shown openness to consider a significant simplification of the VAT, uh, system for reducing the number of freights and limiting the exemptions. Uh, discussions are continuing onto the appropriate fiscal targets. Uh, and we also welcome the government’s intention to, uh, bolster the autonomy of the, uh, revenue administration. Um, so in these areas and agreement  surplus targets, which would not be underpinned by, uh, the credible package, uh, of fiscal savings, uh, would lack credibility. Uh, and, uh, there are o- other important areas where differences, uh, between the political proposals of Greek government, uh, and what would be required, uh, for conclusion of the review, uh, are still very large. Um, so I’m not doing to restate what Pierre just said. Let me just reemphasize a few examples, uh, of policy areas where significant further work is needed. Um, apart from the possible simplification of the VAT, uh, system, uh, the government has not made any substantial proposal for, uh, solid structural revenue expenditure of these consolidation measure, which, uh, underpins a point that any fiscal targets should be backed by, uh, uh, permanent and, and tangible, uh, measures preferably on the, on the, on the uh, on the spending side. Uh, privatization targets are still for substantially short for program requirements and they’re not very specific. Um, the, um, policies for the pension sector, uh, still, uh, lack a, a coherent strategy. Uh, and the, uh, from an ECB standpoint, the non-performing loan, uh, eh, problem, uh, requires special attention. It is, uh, essential that the code of , uh, consultation process. Um, the government’s policy intention is there is area of pensions are clearly, uh,  the programs. So again, this is a scenario where that can be pluses and minuses, but, uh, we, uh, we, we have to discuss the pluses and not only minuses. Uh, regarding product market reform, uh, the government’s policy intentions still lack, uh, ambition and fall short of the program, uh, requirements. Uh, and we also believe that the government should move ahead with the social welfare review and, uh, consider the national  guaranteed minimum income scheme. That is a very important point, uh, because that is about achieving fairness, uh, uh, in the structural reform, uh, program. And, uh, we believe that fairness would be better ensured through a, uh, a, an overlay, uh, general scheme done by, uh, twisting all, uh, individual reforms, uh, toward the distribution, toward the distribution and fairness would be better achieved, uh, through a, uh, uh, uh, uh, a general scheme, uh, uh, allowing other reforms to focus on, uh, on efficiency. Um, so taking all of these together, uh, there has been a narrowing of differences in the limited number of areas. Uh, policy gaps remain large, uh, in others. And the conclusion is that that’s still, uh, a considerable distance, uh, of conclusions of the review. Uh, we need rapid progress, uh, in those areas, uh, where differences remain large. This requires further technical work, uh, in parallel with discussions with the Brussels group, um, and it requires significant, uh, movement from the side of the Greek government. So it’s all possible given the improved, uh, uh, work, uh, uh, atmosphere and improved, uh, trust and working relationships in the Brussels group. It’s all’s, it’s all possible, but there’s still a lot of work.",2015-05-11 00:00:00,ECB
jeroen dijsselbloem,Thank you. Paul?,2015-05-11 00:00:00,EG President
poul mathias thomsen,"Thank you Jeroen. So, i, I agree that, uh, we agree that, uh, there has been progress, uh, both as far as process and as far as substance, uh, concern. On the process, uh, uh, the dis-discussion in the Brussels group have become more open, more cooperative and, and, and better focused on lead negotiator report directly to the prime minister. And this is indeed a, a good news. And I joined Pierre and Benoit for, uh, having listened, uh, uh, uh, to the call for, for improving the process. This being said, uh, the process could clearly improve further. I think it’s important that we are open about this in lieu of the urgency of the situation and the need to be sure that the process does not become an obstacle to a timely conclusion. The main remaining problem is that ministers responsible for policy implementation are still not participating in the discussion. No minister have yet been to, eh, included in the deliberations in Brussels, uh, in, in the Brussels group. As a result, while technical experts finally joined the discussion as last week, they too often still do not have sufficient political gui- political guidance and the information received at the technical and political levels is sometime inconsistent. Moreover, eh, it’s been one of the commitments by negotiators in Brussels are still offer being contradicted by public statements or, or drafting legislation by line ministers in Athens. I think bringing ministers to the table would help overcome these problems. In any case, and I, it’s important for me to stress that fund management will need to be assured before endorsing a program that ministers responsible for implementation support the agreed policies. Again, we do agree that the process improved no-notably, and this is why we are making some progress. So on the issue of substance, eh, I think there has been progress so far in a, in a, in, in three areas. On the VAT reforms, eh, the authorities have, have suggested that they might consider to broaden the base by sign- essentially unifying tax rates with a few exceptions. They still need to indicate that they have sup- political support for this option and agree on tax rates and limitations on exemptions that ensure a notable positive revenue efect. But I think it’s fair to say that this is emerging as one of the potentially more promising areas for common ground for major reforms. Secondly, on the autonomy of revenue administration, this is an area where the authorities initially reversed reforms, uh, that had been made in the past to increase autonomy, including by adopting legislation that, that established in effect, the panel of tax administration undermine the effectiveness of the tax administration and increase the room for political int-interference. I think they … it’s clear signals that they intend on changing course. Uh, and, and, and, and, and understands the importance of a more autonomous agency. Here too, we still need to specify concrete critical details, but this also is an area where I see signs that we could agree on significant reforms. Third, insolvency framework. The authorities committed to undertake a series of reforms of the insolvency framework and, and, uh, and they have provided a draft strategy. Here too, critical details need to be specified and agreed within a comprehensive framework. So this is, this is good news. Uh, uh, uh, it is, it, it’s good news that we have progress in these areas. As others pointed out, it’s, it’s the progress on, uh, on broad objectives and principles and we need, we still need to agree on how to get, on how to achieve it. What are the concrete details? In all the areas, however, including some of the most important ones, we have not made much progress and policy differences remains significant. On the 2015 budget, there are still some differences of views with regard to what should be the primary surplus target for 2015, but the more important difference is that the authorities appear to believe that the fiscal targets can be achieved without any significant additional concrete measures requiring legislative changes. While we are still in the early stages, uh, uh, the authorities appear to believe that these targets can be achieved largely to efficiency measures. Uh, uh, and, and, and as I said that there’s no need for, for, for, for parametric or legislative changes. This is simply not realistic given Greece’s extremely weak administrative capacity and poor historical performance with sorts of administrative measures. The government needs to stand ready to undertake structural fiscal reforms that involves  changes approved by parliament. In this regard, as we have said before, tax rates have already been increased too much on a narrow base and all other expenditures and pensions have already been cut to what is likely to improve unsustainably low levels. It is simply not possible for Greece to meet the ambitious t- ambitious targets for the primary surplus that are still on the table without one comprehensive VAT reform to broaden the tax base and to in particular without pension reforms to reduce but remains exceptionally generous pension benefits. And suspension reform would need to produce significant savings, savings in the coming years and not in the distant future. Moving on to structural reforms, this is certainly not the time and place to go into, into a detailed discussion. The big picture is that most of the major areas for reform, notably pension reform, civil service reforms, public administration reforms and the labor market reforms. Uh, in most of these areas, the s- in all of these mentioned areas, the authorities are significantly backtracking, reversing policies already in place or saying the intent to reverse policies already in place and going back on program commitments about the future. We understand and I want to be clear about that. We understand that the authorities acknowledged that no reforms are not an option and that they, the point to them is that they want to do things differently and we of course accepted. But generally they have not told us … They, they have told us what they do not want to do, but they have not told us what they want to do. They, they have told us what they want to subtract, but they have not told us what they want to add. So until we know what to add, we will in a situation where there appears to be a track of undoing many of the key reforms implemented since 2010 without putting anything else in, in, in, in, in place. In conclusion, although it should improve further, the process now clearly works better. This has enabled us to finally start making some tangible progress on substance, although details still needs to be specified in all of these areas. We’ve definitely made progress. Moreover we are still, there are still, uh, uh, uh, uh, important differences in some of the most, most important policy areas. In general, the government still needs to be much more concrete about what it wants to do. Let me, uh … And I, I think, uh, it’s, it’s certainly encourage, courage, encouraging that we are making progress, but we obviously still far away from, from the staff level agreement. And uh, uh, uh, I, I, I, I join my two colleagues in, in, in, in encouraging the authorities to, to redouble the effort, given the, the, the time constraint and the urgency. Finally, and I should be very brief in, in, in view of the leaks from Riga and the press statements about the … misleading press statements of what I said about getting that sustainability. Let me be sure that there are no misunderstandings. To be very clear, we are not pushing for debt relief. We are not. Rather from a debt sustainability point of view, you would agree that there is an inverse relief, inverse relationship between the strengths of, of, of reforms and the amount of relief that would be required. What I said in Riga was, if there are major deviations from the program in the form of reduced targets and weakening of reforms, in that case, more financing would be needed. In this regard, carrying on more debt in a situation where Greece indebtedness is already very high, would point to the need for a more comprehensive debt measures than currently assumed. Thus, we would not be able to significantly weaken the program without accepting the need for significant move from the financing and significant move of debt relief, just to clarify.

thomas wieser,"Thanks very much. Uh, very shortly we had, uh, a stock taking exercise in the EWG, uh, on Friday. Uh, the institutions, uh, reported … Uh, I need not go into that again. This has been done, uh, in detail . Maybe just on, uh, timing as it, as it was discussed. Uh, it’s obvious from, uh, the reports that, uh, the remaining gaps are still, uh, significant. Uh, there will need to be very significant convergence, uh, on, uh, numerous areas. And in the best of circumstances, uh, this is a very complex iterative, uh, process which takes, uh, weeks and sometimes even months. We know, however, that, uh, the clock is ticking. Uh, the program expires 30th June, the liquidity situation, uh, is more than tight. So it is of the essence that, uh, removes from more discussion-oriented, uh, phase to a real negotiating, uh, phase. Uh, what needs to become quite granular and, uh, very precise, and what is being, uh, put on the table and how it’s explained and how this is tied down, uh, binding the, uh, binding for all participants. And, uh, this is, uh … I think the major, uh, concern that I would have that there is not, it’s not quite clear, uh, I think, how we get, uh, from here to staff level agreements, uh,  to disbursement, uh, in the remaining seven, seven weeks of the program.

yanis varoufakis,"Thank you very much Jorun. Uh, let me start also, uh, with a comment on leaks. Um, it would be good if there were none, but if there are leaks, it would be good if they were accurate. I never heard Paul Thompson, uh, discuss, uh, debt restructuring,  in Riga and I never had any one of you, uh, hurl abuse at me or personal insults despite what was, uh, um, widely reported in the press. So please, no leaks. But if you leak, if anybody leaks, they might as well be accurate with the leaks. Now, colleagues, over the last, uh, three months and especially after the 20th_february, Eurogroup agreement, we’ve been striving to find common ground between the pre-existing program and our government’s priorities. It hasn’t been easy for reasons that were mostly political, but also partly to do with process, technical. A very belief comment here because, uh, several, uh, representatives of the, uh, institutions mentioned it, how it will expedite the process if ministers were part of the Brussels group. Let me say that this is something that, uh, uh, we have very strong views about and which we have discussed with the commission in particular – ministers only talk to ministers. And this is a principle that we have to abide by. It’s the principle of, uh, the Greek government, which I’m simply mandated to convey to you now. Now, nevertheless, we believe that the last fortnight as was said here by others, has produced substantial progress, partly because of a tightened negotiating process that removed procedural inefficiencies, but primarily because of major concessions on the Greek side. Agreement has not been reached, despite the substantial convergence achieved. The institutions wish to suggest that this imperfect convergence may be due to our, uh, reluctance to move further. Our side could retort that convergence has not been reached, because the agreement point has, has not, uh, appeared on the horizon due to the stance of the institutions. But it would be imprudent to enter into such a fruitless exchange at the moment. This Eurogroup meeting must help the negotiations move onward toward a successful outcome and refrain from anything that may impede that progress. This is what our mandate is at this crucial time for our currency union, for our country. So in this spirit, in the spirit of helping the process along, it is important and right that the substantial progress that has been made and the substantial concessions by our side be acknowledged in our communicate today. We have, as you heard, moved very substantially towards an independent tax authority. We have tabled particularly radical views of this, radical by the standards of any great government. Let me refer to something that was said. I think it was Paul that said it about backtracking there initially. It’s a very simple situation. The tax authority that the, that the general secretary for public revenues is part of my ministry. I am politically responsible for it. It has a quasi autonomous, um, existence at the moment, which means that I have political responsibility for what it does without having any authority over it. To enhance its autonomy while retaining the responsibility of the minister is to have responsibility without authority. And that is not something that is like, I think it wouldn’t be acceptable to any of you. So this is why I suggested let’s go the whole hog. Let’s render it, let’s just excise it completely from my ministry, thick walls of my ministry and turn it into a fully independent authority like the IRS for instance, which is answerable to parliament. I won’t bother you further with this. I think that we have a very good understanding of this with, with the institutions. On the question of the NPLS, there’s been significant progress towards convergence agreement on this question. On VAT, it was, um, our side that initiated the discussion about harmonizing, having two different rates and rationalizing the system, the question of pinning down precisely what those rates must be. And I’m here referring to something that Paul said, um, is something that we’ll have to do very carefully so as to ensure that on the one hand, yes Paul, you’re right, we have to increase the, the, the VAT, uh, take. But secondly, we must not make assumptions that, uh, raise the top rate too high and have the opposite effect. If at the moment we assume zero elasticity and we simply, um, pitch the top rate where it would have to be, if there was no increase in sales and VAT collection, then we will end up with such a high rate, the top rate, that we will, we will be doing damage to the potential tax state. So this is something that we really need to study properly and not simply, um, leave to horse trading at the Brussels group over a period of a few hours. This is very serious business, as I’m sure everybody agrees. On the questions of pensions, our government has moved away from the 13th pension idea for people, for pensioners below 700 and towards targeting, um, pensioners below the poverty line and targeting them efficiently. Uh, I know that the term 13th pension jars with lots of you. In our culture, it doesn’t, because it wasn’t really a 13th pension. It was simply a way of calculating annual payments, uh, in terms of simply giving more installments. Uh, I think that there’s significant pro-, um, uh, progress there. Now the idea that it’s kind of backtracking to eliminate the zero deficit clause that the previous government accepted and introduced, we would like to challenge that. I don’t want to bother you too much with this, but we have a view that city, simply cutting down pensions is not informing them. Maybe we need to cut them down. But to reform the pension system, we have to render it sustainable. And that means finding ways of boosting employment. Very importantly, reducing undeclared labor, which is now around one third of all paid labor. And you can understand that th- … Th-th-that number is just horrific. No pension system can really be rendered sustainable when you’ve got a third of paid laborers, employees, um, undeclared in the black market, so to speak. Um, we certainly are moving towards closing down all the windows that are making earlier diamonds, not only possible, but also, um, a method by which certain corporations and companies are pushing workers off their payroll onto the pension fund system. Uh, on the question of the Greek statistical office, they’ll start. Uh, we have drafted legisla- legislation that increases transparency, um, and accountability. These two have to go together. You can’t have an independent statistical office if it is not accountable and transparent. Now on the question, let me just say that other questions of macroeconomic focus that Paul referred to, I think we have significant convergence on the, of the two sides. Our focus of, of real GDP growth for 2015 differs from that of institutions only marginally, I would say within the realm of statistical error. And the real difference is not so much about nominal GDP, but it’s about the deflation rate. If we agree on the rate of deflation, then we will get much closer on the, o-o-on the real GDP growth. And this is important because our rate of deflation at the moment has been exacerbated by the standoff and the liquidity squeeze. It’s a monetary phenomenon as everybody knows. Now, besides the importance of acknowledging these concessions and their contribution to the conversions that we’ve all observed, it is also important to ensure that our communicate today plays a role in securing the advances we’ve made so far. And preventing any untoward events that might cause unnecessary plo-problems both for Greece and more broadly. I’m referring of course to my government’s capacity to function and to meet its obligations while the negotiations continue. Let me remind you colleagues that even though we have no market access, we haven’t had market access for a very long while, and we have no disbursements for eight months now. Our government is continuing to meet all its obligations to international creditors. We will be doing again this tomorrow morning. Indeed, our government, since our election has made payments to international creditors without market access or disbursements amounting to 14% of GDP in annualized terms. This is quite an extraordinary effort that must be acknowledged, together with an acknowledgment that these payments have been made at the expense of a virtual cessation of payments to local Greek creditors of the government, for instance, to suppliers of the Greek state. In addition, as is well known and I think Benoit mentioned it, we have dipped into every available reserve of the Greek, of the general Gre-Greek government, be it the health service, universities, willing municipalities, et cetera. Now, this extraordinary effort to fulfill our obligations to the IMF primarily and other creditors must receive its the acknowledgment in today’s communicate. On several occasions, we have been assured that as long as there is, as there is progress in the negotiations and convergence, the Greek state will have access to the liquidity necessary to carry on with its essential functions. I believe it is beyond the out that the negotiations have been progressing well enough to justify our expectation that the assurances that are just mentioned concerning our liquidity be upheld. Now, let me inform you colleagues that this is not quite so at the moment. We have now reached the point, as we speak, where the slightest perturbation in our tax revenues from a day to day basis or in our expenditures … Let me give you an example: suppose there is an extensive forest fire of the kind that will become forthcoming soon, given the change in seasons. Any such perturbation may well cause an accident. Also, and this is important having dipped into se-, so many organizations reserves, we run a serious risk that essential services may be jeopardized by unforeseen, yet not improbable events. In short, the assurance that as long as there is progress in the negotiations, the Greek state will have access to the liquidity necessary to carry on with its essential functions is currently not fulfilled, I’m afraid. It is for this reason and with the view to allowing the negotiations to converge fully into an agreement point that our government requests of today’s Eurogroup, that our communicate contains whatever phraseology  is necessary to allow the relevant institutions to top up our state’s liquidity to a level consistent with the reassurances I just mentioned. Lastly, let me ask a question that no one has asked me in this context out of courtesy, I think, but which I’m sure that many of you have on your mind. If our liquidity is so low, why don’t we just move faster in the negotiations? Why do we not bridge the gap on the outstanding issues much more quickly? I’m sure this is the question that most of you have in your mind. Let me answer this question, colleagues, that the answer is that we had determined that the agreement, which will result from these negotiations will be wind that we shall see through. That we shall be able to look at you in the eye at the time of signing the agreement and genuinely say, “We, the Greek government, can do this,” but the see this, we must believe that the fiscal targets, the pension labor market reforms, the product market reforms and so on, that all those parts, elements of the agreement, will be targets that we can reach maybe with a huge effort. Not maybe, definitely with a huge efforts and it would be the forms that we can excite the Greek people into supporting, unlike the previous unhappy experience with the programs reform agendas. So signing off on an agreement that we do not think is right, that we do not think will achieve the Greek targets would be an act of dishonesty to our partners, to you, and to our people. I have no doubt that no one in this room would want us to sign off, uh, dishonestly. Repeating mistakes and misdemeanors that past Greek governments committed. So to conclude, much prog-progress has been made. More progress is necessary. We can reach an agreement soon. But to get there, we need a communicate this evening that creates the right atmosphere both in here and outside and allows all of us, including the institutions, to do what it takes to smooth in the bath to the agreement point that I’m sure we’ll, we all want.

Uh, one has to understand that with very low interest rates, the potential for uncertainty, and very high volatility is higher than at high interest rates. Because when- when the interest rates are very low, and around zero, even  interest rates all along the curve. And so anything that might affect expectations of higher interest rates in the short term, would have an effect quite magnified over longer term interest rates, so… And the same thing holds for inflation expectations of course. They would, would reverberate on interest rates. So that’s why it certainly should be properly taken into account in the stability programs, by- by the various governments.

Uh, we had a very, very good, uh, discussion of this. And I think, uh, , uh, quite openness to discuss that, uh, further. Um, it was I think here emphasized, uh, by many of the colleagues, uh, that what we were looking at in terms of pure interest rate reductions does not reflect the net savings, budget. Because, uh, very often, uh, especially in this low inflation environment, you will also have, uh, cyclically, uh, lower revenues. , uh, on the debt structure, maturity structure. Uh, and also, uh, the structure of course of government assets. But, um, if one turns to the use, uh, of such  policy responses, I would say it became, uh, fairly clear, uh, that there’s support for the idea that the higher, uh, government deficits, and government, uh, debt levels are, the more such windfall profits should be used for fiscal consolidation. And the lower, uh, they are, the more likely it is that they should be used, uh, for the, uh, government, uh, investment projects. Uh, clear emphasis . And, uh, if one, uh, looks over one’s shoulder, uh, what have we experienced so far? Uh, there are two ways of looking at identical, uh, .

speaker 3,"Thank you, Jeroen. Uh, actually the debate has already gone a long way in pointing out pitfalls and opportunities of low interest rate environment. I would start from Mario’s point, which, uh, should set, uh, framework for all policy decisions related to lower interest rates. That lower interest rates are not here for to stay forever. At some stage we will see some return to some normal state of- of the world, including interest rates that are a little bit higher at least. Uh, so this to me, uh, suggests that the lower interest rate environment should be seen  a- a weaker euro, uh better inflationary expectations, and of course easier monetary provisions. And therefore the first- the first, uh, implication I would draw for policy is, uh, since there is a window of opportunity, which by definition will close up sooner than expected possibly, please let’s all not make the mistake of not exploiting that window of opportunity by pushing forward the  programs that in many, our- our cases, certainly in my case if I may, uh, is very much at the center of the agenda. This is a very general point, which does not relate to technicalities of the fiscal implications. Second, this has been mentioned by both, and I will not dwell on it. But it’s very important. What can we do to, uh, help, uh, institutional investors do better in such an environment? Of course the assumption that these low rates will go away at some stage, will have to impact on long term investment decisions. So it’s not just, uh, it’s not that straight forward how, what are the implications for institutional investors? Although I very much subscribe to the view that more, uh… a larger choice set, let me put it that way. A larger choice set should be allowed to these investors. Having said that, but then Pierre pointed out very clearly, of course the lower interest rates come along with an environment, where nominal growth, both nominal and real growth are lower, and inflation is also, uh, not high enough. So from that point of view, of course the impact on public finance of- of, uh, nom- a low nominal growth en- en- environment, has other implications. One must mention that- that it has caused an implication on revenues, which themselves would be lower. And this of course, uh, adds to the environment as, uh, the benchmark against which we have to assess. But also another point maybe worth mentioning, that while we have lower interest rates on- on government debt for a number of reasons, it is not always obvious to what extent this is transmitted to other interest rates in the market, to what extent there is a channel  in terms of easier financial conditions or not. This may work both ways. But, uh, it’s also important to, uh, to take that into account. Coming to the point that was central in the presentation very quickly, uh, what should we do with that space that is generated by lower nominal, uh, interest rates? A- apart from measurement problems, how do we exactly measure the additional fiscal space generated by lower rates? Which has to do with the well known problems of measuring the impact, uh, on, uh, uh, uh, w- what is the cyclical impact? What is the impact of cyclical conditions on potential output, uh, coming from that, uh, just, uh, ? I want to conclude with, uh, two lessons that I would, uh, draw. One, uh… Actually three lessons. One is, uh, yes that, uh, the, uh, amount of resources, uh, freed up by that window, should, uh, be devoted to, uh, making your fiscal stance stronger. Uh, which however can be seen in a number of ways. Not only, uh, uh, not only, uh, moderating your spending, but also modifying the composition of your spending towards more capital investment, which in many cases is complementary to the structure . And of course I very much subscribe to  quoting you if I may. Um, the other point, and I’m finished, is that there is, uh, and opportunity with lower interest rates to improve debt management. To take benefit of the immediate lower cost of funding for the budget. And so to, uh, reassess the structure of your funding, your- your debt management, which will be helpful once at some stage the interest rate environment will be higher. So this is an additional element we should be taking into account, into asking what can we do to use that space, in order to improve our fiscal sustainability?

I always felt that they’re a little bit, you know, out there, a little bit strange and institutional, especially EFS. That was your, the big thing. And climbing aboard the institution, I feel very privileged to be here. And I guess in my previous capacity, um, uh, as PM, I sort of felt that I was Jack of all trades, but master of none. Now suddenly I feel I have to be here as a master of lower interest rate environment windfall. Uh, so I feel quite humbled to make this intervention. If I sound good, you should probably thank  next to me. If I sound bad, you know that my learning curve is still quite steep. Uh, I’ll be quite brief looking at this issue, uh, from the Finnish perspective, by making basically, uh, three, uh, general, uh, remarks. Obviously we agree with the conclusions of the Commission. But the remarks are- are pretty much on the analysis, uh, side. The, uh, first, uh, remark is that we see, much as the previous speakers, the decline of interest rates coming from two different aspects, and thus having probably, uh, two different implications. So the two reasons are, one is the retreat of the sovereign debt crisis, which has obviously  at least until, uh, last week. Uh, and- and it’s helped all the risk countries. There’s no question about that. But then it hasn’t affected the non-risk countries that much. And the other reason is obviously low growth, uh, where, uh the key role uh, has pretty much affected all of us in- in one way or another. I assume that in this role you’re not supposed to comment about the ECB, ECB that’s why I’ve always given my full support to what the ECB has done, not least in quantitative easing, not least in keeping actually interest rates low, and trying to get our, uh, economies going. So some benefit from both, and others from just one. Now, a second point is what kind of effects does this have? Um, I guess if it’s linked to the prices, uh, this was said I think quite eloquently by the Italian minister. Then we should try to reduce, use the moment to try to reduce, uh, debt right now. Then on the other hand if it’s linked to growth, my question is, is it really windfall ? The final point is very much from a Finnish perspective. I guess the report looks very much at the debt side, uh, debt . But in Finland I guess is a slightly different case. Because for us we’re in a situation whereby we have public assets, much more than debt. I think the ratio is something, our debt is, uh, 100 billion euros, uh, and our public assets approximate to 185. So .",2015-06-18 00:00:00,Finland

luis de guindos,"Thank you . Uh, the- the interest rate that matter for- for the economy are not nominal interest rates, are real interest rates. And, uh, inflation rates all over, all over Europe, uh, have been very low, uh, lately. So real interest rates, uh, are real- are really, uh, uh, uh, higher than nominal interest rates. So, uh, you know there is a- a parallel evolution of nominal interest rates, and inflation expectation, and actual inflation- inflation rates. Even if we look at, uh, the impact on the fiscal policy, it’s obvious that, uh, lower nominal interest rates have any positive impact on the evolution of the, uh, of the- of the- of the deficit, on the expenditure side. But simultaneously very low, uh, uh, inflation rates, and very low, uh, nominal GDP growth rates also have an impact, a relative impact. So, I think that we are going to live a process of normalization. I think that nominal interest rates will go up, in parallel with the evolution of inflation expectations. And, uh, well, we have had a windfall profit, let’s say because of the low environment, or the environment of low interest rates. But simultaneously, simultaneously I think that higher nominal growth rates will be a helping hand for tax revenues.

yanis varoufakis,"The EKAS that Pierre mentioned, from the lowest of the low of pensions as the institutions have asked. Because that would push the poorest of the poor into grave- d- greater poverty and create a wave of hostility to whatever agreement and r- reform package we agree upon. In our proposals to the institutions we have offered very serious reforms. We’ve offered an extensive, but optimized privatization agenda spanning the period from this year to 2025. We’ve offered, offered, proposed the creation of a fully independent tax and customs authority under the aegis of the provision of parliament so that politicians, uh, but also corporate interests, h- hold no sway over tax collection. We proposed a fiscal council that oversees the State budget, a short-term program for limiting foreclosures and managing non-performing loans, judicial and civil procedural code reforms, liberalizing several product markets and services, am- elimination of many nuisance charges. Public administration reforms introducing, for instance, proper staff evaluation systems, reducing non-wage costs, modernizing and unifying public sector payrolls. In addition to these reforms, the Greek authorities have engaged the OECD to help our government design, implement and monitor a second series of reforms. Only yesterday I met with the OECD’s Secretary General, Mr. Gurría, and his team and mine announced a joint reform agenda complete with a specific road map that we’ve, we’ll focus on. A major anti-corruption drive and relevant institutions to support it, especially in the area of procurement. Liberalizing the construction sector, including the market and standards of construction materials. Wholesale trade liberalization. The unification of, uh, electronic and press codes of practice in the media. One-stop business centers that eradicate the bureaucratic impediments to doing business in Greece. Help on the front of pension reform, where the emphasis will be on proper long term actuarial studies, the phasing out, almost complete eradication of early retirements; the reduction in the operating costs of the pension funds; pension fund consolidation. Yes, colleagues, Greece needs to adjust further. But what we are calling upon is to agree with us, to concur with the difference between reforms that are attacking parasitic rent-seeking behavior on the one hand, or inefficiencies and, on the other hand, parametric changes that jack apt- jack up tax rates and reduce benefits to the weakest. We need a lot more of real re- reforms and a lot less of the parametric type. Now, much has been said about backtracking on labor market reform and our determination to bring in to the equation again, collective bargaining agreements in con- collaboration with the International Labor Organization and the OACD. Is this some kind of left wing fixation we have with collective bargaining? No, it is not. I’ll give you an example: Young workers in several chain, uh, stores get fired as they approach their 24th birthday so that this employer hires younger workers in their place to avoid paying them the extra €80 a week, or a week … A month, I should say, which along the lines of existing minimum wage legislation applies to under 24 year olds. Or take the case of employees who are hired part-time for less than €300 a month, but which are, who are made to work full-time and threatened with dismissal if they complain. Without a system of smart collective bargaining agreements these abuses abound with ill effects and competition because decent employers don’t do this and they have to compete against employers who do. But also with ill effects on pension funds. Does anyone seriously think that the introduction of a well th- thought out collective bargaining, uh, framework, in collaboration with international instit- institutions, like the ILO or the OACD, constitutes reform reversal or backtracking? We don’t think so. Now, briefly allow me to turn back to pensions. Much has been made of the fact that the pensions account in Greece form more than they did in the past, as much as 16% of GDP. However, consider this: Pensions have shrunk by almost 40/45%, and the number of pensions, pensioners, is stable. So expenditure on pensions has fallen but the percentage has increased because GDP has collapsed over the last five years. Our alleged backtracking on pension reforms is that we have suspended the further reduction in pensions that have already lost 40% of their value when, and this is important, the prices of goods and services that pensioners need, like pharmaceuticals, have hardly moved. Consider this rele- relatively unknown fact: Around one million families, that is a very large number in a population of 10 million, survive today on the meager pension of a grandfather or a grandmother as the rest of the family members are unemployed in a country where only 9% of them employed have ever collected any unemployment benefit. Diminishing that one solitary pension in those households is tantamount to turning a family into the streets. This is why we keep telling the institutions that, “Yes. We need pension reform. But, no. We cannot just cut 1% of GDP off pensions through one way or the other without creating substantial hardship and also giving another turn to the wheel of the recessionary forces.” If 1.8 billion is taken out of this economy from the lowest of the low of social strata if you take into consideration the multiplier effects that the IMF has con-, uh, confessed in the past to have underestimated. We’re talking about another spin of the deflationary wheel. Now, I suppose that institutions are asking us to eliminate these solitary, solidarity pensions, the EKAS, because already this, the, the, the distribution of pension income has been compressed so much that if you’re going to reduce pension costs today by 1% of GDP you have to attack the lowest of the low of pensions. It can’t be done any other way. Structural reforms, colleagues, of course, promote b- growth potential, but mere cutbacks in an economy like Greece is, promote recession. Greece must adjust by introducing genuine reforms, as I said. But, at the same time, going back to Doctor Blanchard’s que-, uh, answer, or question, I believe the institutions need to adjust their definition of growth enhancing reforms to acknowledge that parametric cuts and tax hikes are not reforms that will help Greece today. Now, colleagues have remarked in the past in the Eurogroup, and I understand that, that our pensions are higher than theirs, and they fear that the Greek government may be having designs to ask in the context of a transfer union that we do not have, as Pierre said, for your pensioners to be supporting ours. Let me be very clear on this. We’re never going to ask you to do this. We’re never going to ask you to subsidize our State, our wages, our pensions, our public en- expenditure. Indeed, this is not a transfer union. But, colleagues, the Greek State has been living within its means for a while. Over the past five months we have even managed, despite zero market access and zero disbursements, to repay up to eight billion to our creditors and do intend to keep doing so. Now, I understand there are concerns that our government may slip into a primary dece- deficit again. And I think, I, that this is the reason why the institutions are pressing us to accept large VAT rises, parametric changes and parametric pension cuts. Now, while there’s a view that the announcement of a viable agreement at early next, uh, early next week I, we, one hopes, will suffice to boost economic activity sufficiently to generate a pri- a healthy primary surplus, I understand perfectly well that our creditors, you, may have cause to be skeptical and to want safeguards, an insurance policy against our government’s possible slide into profligacy again. This is what I believe lies behind Doctor Blanchard’s call for the Greek government to offer, and I quote, “Truly credible measures.” So here comes an idea: What we consider to be a truly credible idea. Instead of arguing over half a percentage point of measures or whether these measures should be parametric or, uh, administrative, how about a deeper, more comprehensive, permanent reform? An automated hard deficit break that is legislated and monitored by the independent fiscal council that we, and the institutions, have already agreed upon? The fiscal council would, under this agreement, monitor the State’s budget execution on a week by week basis, issue warnings if a minimum primary surplus target looks like being violated in the foreseeable future and, at some point, the fiscal council, the independent fiscal bo- council could trigger automated across the board horizontal reductions in all State outlays so as to prevent the slide below the pre-agreed threshold for the, for the primary surplus. That way we will have a fail safe system that ensures the solvency of the Greek State and its primary surplus while the Greek government retates, retains the policy space it needs in order to remain sovereign and able to govern within a democratic context. Consider this a firm proposal that our government is prepared to implement as part of an immediate agreement. Now, given that our government will never again need to borrow from our ta- from your taxpayers or from the taxpayer standing behind the International Monetary Fund, the debate should now move, or should quickly move, from pensions and VAT to the very central question about primary surpluses. How large should they be? Does anyone seriously believe that the growth rate of an economy like ours who’s been deprived of serious bank credit and investment flows is, uh, independent of the primary targets set? The IMF understands fully that the two numbers are linked endogenously. And this is the reason why Greece’s public debt must be looked at once again. Our large debt overhang should be thought of as a large unfunded tax liability. While it is true that the HFSF and GLF slices of our debt are long dated and the interest rate is low, it is also true, colleagues, that the Greek State’s unfunded tax liability, our debt, features a lumpy component that impedes investment and recovery today. I am referring here, in particular, to the 27 billions of SMP bonds still held by the ECB. Now, this is short-dated, unfunded liability that potential investors in Greece, even after an agreement has been struck, will take a look at and turn back because they can see the funded gap this part of our debt creates because they recognize that this lump of 27 billion on the books of the ECB stops Greece from taking advantage of quantitative easing while, at the same time, creating a short term funding gap. It is indeed an irony, perhaps a cruel irony, irony, that the country most afflicted by deflation in the Eurozone today, is the one, the only one, effectively, that is excluded from the ECB’s anti-deflation remedy, and it is excluded even after an agreement has been struck because of this lump of 27 million, billion of SMP bonds. So our proposal of this front is I, we believe simple, efficient and mutually beneficial. We propose no new monies, not one fresh Euro, for our State. No new debt for Greece. But imagine the following three part agreement to be announced at a press conference over the next few days. Part one: The deeper reforms that I mentioned, including the automated hard deficit break that I suggested. Second part: A rationalization of Greece’s debt repayment schedule along the following lines: First, to effect an SMP buy back from the ECB, Greece would acquire a new loan facility from the ESM, would use it to purchase the SMP bonds back from the ECB and to retire them. To underpin this loan, like every loan agreement needs a conditionality, we could agree that the deep reform agenda that will be part of this agreement acts as a common conditionality for successfully completing the current program and for securing the new ESM arrangement that comes into operation immediately afterwards and runs concurrently with a continuing IMF program until the end of March 2016. Short term funding relies on the outstanding disbursement for the current program. And medium to long term funding is completed by the return of the SMP profits coming up to about nine billion out of the 27, which will go, could go into an us- escrow account, doesn’t come to Greece at all even, so as to repay in the medium term, the IMF. And part three of this agreement, as we envisage it, is an investment program for kick starting the Greek economy. Nothing to do with the Eurogroup that would, could be part of the Junker Plan, the European Investment Bank, with which we are in talks already, the ABLT and other partners, who will be invited to participate, also in conjunction with our privatization program and the establishment of a development bank that aims at developing, reforming and collat- collateralizing public assets, including real estate owned by the State. Does anyone doubt that such a three part announcement would dramatically change the mood, inspire Greeks to work hard in hope of a better future, invite investors to a country who’s asset prices have fallen so dramatically and give confidence to Europeans that Europe can even, at this eleventh hour, do the right thing? Colleagues, I close by saying, at this juncture, it is dangerously easy to think that nothing can be done. Let us not fall prey to this state of mind. We can forge a good agreement. Our government is standing by with ideas, with a will to compromise further, and with a determination to cultivate the two forms of trust necessary to end the Greek gov- the Greek drama. Your trust in us, and the trust of our people, both in their government and in Europe’s capacity to produce policies that work for them too. Thank you.",2015-06-18 00:00:00,Greece

benoît cœuré,"Thank you Jeroen. I share the perplexity  and I agree with Michael Noonan, we have heard about that diluted version but we do not know exactly what’s inside. I think it is an encouraging movement that the institutions have tried to bridge the gap, and as Michel Sapin rightly said, will come from the primary surplus of 3% to a primary surplus of 1 %  short term compromise and in fact, the two questions I would like to raise are the following. The first one is what are the needs, the financial needs of the Greek government in the short to medium term, and by medium term I don’t mean five years, I mean six months to a year. And there, I think that the Commission has told us the numbers are starting to become quite impressive and they go beyond they go beyond the 7.2 per cent, er, the 7.2 billion that are in the present program. So do we have a calculation of what are the needs over six months to one year, not only in terms of repayment of credits, but just in terms of the needs of the government and of the economy. That brings me to my 3rd remark. When I see the outflows that have been described by the European Central Bank, obviously I am very worried. Second, we know that the economic situation has deteriorated quite a lot, in Greece, in the last couple of months, because when we agreed on the provisional agreement on 20th_february we were still assuming that there would be growth in Greece and we see that that is not the case. So we have an economy that is deteriorating, investments that go out or outflows that are rising very very quickly, so we have at hand an economic situation that has become even more difficult than what we were expecting before. So, today’s two questions, what is the real economic situation today and what are the needs in the months to come in terms of finance, does that have an influence on the agreement that we want to have by the end of the month? I can put it also differently, do we want to have a kind of short term fix or do we want to have a little bit more a medium term solution to these problems?",2015-06-18 00:00:00,ECB

jeroen dijsselbloem,"Thank you colleagues, for your comments and questions  after months of bottom-up process, uh, the aide memoire was an expression of a top-down process, saying this is where we could land, this where we could find each other. And except that, it has no formal status, you have to realize that. It was not agreed upon. The moment it is sent to us as a Eurogroup it would become a document and some ministers may have to send it to their parliaments etc. This is a thing that we really have to consider. So bilaterally, I am sure that the institutions are willing to inform ministers on the main headlines of the content of that document  which I would be hesitative to make it into a formal document by sending it to the Eurogroup. We are in the midst of a negotiation, which has not led to results. My position has been, uh, I ve told  in one of the meeting president Juncker and PM Tsipras, I have made very clear there that the Eurogroup does not in itself negotiate. This is done by the institutions. They will assess and value the proposals that are being put on the table. This is not the role of the Eurogroup. If within the framework that we have given, political mandate, some of you have quite rightly said that already what has been happening is outside of that mandate, but if within that mandate an agreement is reached between Greece and the institutions, then it is up to us to take political decisions on whether we want to take that to our responsibility and to our parliaments, that I think should be the order, but I understand. I fully sympathize with those of you that said we do not really have all the information, I think this is not possible, but if so required I’m sure the institutions can provide bilaterally more information on details, on the process and the content. The second point was made, what if we reach an agreement in the short term  coming months, at least until the end of the year. It also depends on the package that is agreed, so for more final calculations on what the financing look like in the medium term and the long term will be made of course once there’s an agreement at hand, we are not there yet. It is absolutely true, and the Commission also say as well, that the situation, of course, in Greece is deteriorating rapidly, it has been since the beginning of this year, making the process moving forward even more difficult and challenging. On those of you that have said “has the time not come to draw conclusions”, I think that it’s not for us here to draw the conclusions. The process is not at an end, there is still a window of opportunity though it is very small and it is very challenging and it is first and foremost, I think most of you agree, to the Greek government to grasp that last opportunity in the coming days, I think also Michel made that point, the process does not end here today, we should not let it fall out of our hands at this point. The risks certainly for Greece, but also the Eurozone, cannot be underestimated. Having said that, I think that the role of the Eurogroup at this point is simply to take stock of the situation, to await further steps from the Greek government to work- to urge them to work with the institutions, come up with new proposals that can then be assessed. The Eurogroup stands ready to convene, to re-convene if an agreement is still possible. Then we will also go into questions like Pierre and others have asked, what does that mean for the medium term, what’s the prospect, etc. At the same time we must also be very clear in our communication that in any scenario we are determined to work closely together in this monetary union to strengthen the Eurozone, the Five President’s report will be very helpful in that respect, I think we have to make absolutely clear that in any scenario the Eurozone will come out strong. Any agreement, if still possible, will have to be credible also from that perspective, I think as Michael said it also has to be credible for the Eurozone as a whole and I think that’s a very, very important point. Those would be my conclusions at this point. In terms of communication… in terms of communication I would just like to go through a couple of lines of communication that I will use after this meeting, it is up to you to say whether you want to . Today I think we send a strong signal to the Greek authorities that it is up to them to fully engage with the institutions on the base of the aide memoire in the framework of the Eurogroup statement of the 20th_february. However, the current agreement, the current agreement expires in less than two weeks. An agreement is still possible but will have to be credible and solid both for the benefit of  those will in general terms be my lines of communication to be used after this meeting.

And the second thing, which is important for me, Jeroen you say that it is up to the institutions to find a solution is not the work of, by the institutions, it must be done by the Eurogroup.",2015-06-18 00:00:00,Austria
jeroen dijsselbloem,"On your two points. First of all, what I certainly didn’t want is to trigger a discussion now about the aide memoire and whether that is inside or outside the framework of the 20th_february. I don’t think we are in a position to judge, um, strictly speaking we haven’t  the document um, so let’s leave that aside. The second point is that, quite rightly, if there is no agreement there are also decisions to be taken and you can be sure that we will act and we will prepare and the institutions are also preparing other scenarios, so you are not quite right when you say that other scenarios are not for the institutions to prepare but for us  but a lot of work will also have simply have to be done by the institutions even without our explicit decision. But in either scenario, work is ahead of us, that is for sure. Let me also say that if there is to be a Eurozone summit, which I don’t know, this is not up to us to decide, if there is to be such a leaders’ meeting, that must be and will be prepared by the Eurogroup. This is also in the rules and regulations, Eurozone summits will be prepared by the Eurogroup. So our involvement doesn’t stop here, that’s for sure. Our involvement is crucial and will stay crucial.

I don’t think it would be wise for us to now to take a decision on whether we have come to the end of the process, we’ve not.

I did react to it by saying it must be discussed by the institutions first. He may not agree with that procedure, but this is how we work, it’s the only way we can work. We cannot assess new proposals being brought into the meeting like this. They have to be assessed and discussed with the institutions first. My assessment that there is still a window of opportunity and it is certainly in the interest of the Greek people to try and grasp that opportunity and we stand ready even though time is very very short  to see whether that opportunity can be used and will be used.

christine lagarde,"Thank you very much. Um. I think this document that we have received is actually both um strategic and smart. It’s strategic because it was released, certainly to us at uh half past midnight in version one, at eight am in version two, and ten am in version three. So I don’t know whether version four is coming or whether we’ll have something else to expect but  it’s very strategic. And it’s coming so late, which sadly the way because we could have made much more progress had we had the opportunity and the time to just go through the general proposal. It is smart in the way that it seems to use the framework of what we have called repeatedly the aide memoire, which as you will remember is this document which cannot be really shared without issue with some parliament but which is in and of itself uh a diluted version from the aide memoire so this strategic and smart document is moving in that direction, of the aide memoire but is certainly not the aide memoire as it is. Neither from the fiscal standpoint, which is also very smartly addressed, nor in the content, nor in the structural reforms, nor in the smart omissions that  here and there put in the document. So having been negative, as is quite often expected from the IMF, but honest to what I have had about twenty minutes to go through, I think that they are positive moves in quite a few directions but it lacks specificity, it’s only semi comprehensive, and we need to actually sit down and do some real technical work in order to assess what will be unleashed by the various proposals. We cannot say because there is point zero X of VAT or point zero Y of VAT or because there will be additional contributions to finance the pensions system as is proposed in some instances, it’s going to bridge the gap. What I’d do a simple, stupid exercise of comparing what we had in the aide memoire which was one percentage GDP out of pension reform, one percentage of GDP out of VAT reform, and half a percentage of GDP out of subsidies reform. It doesn’t add up for the moment but I don’t want to prejudge because we have not had time to actually do the work that needs to be done. The only comment that I would make on the substance is that we find it quite growth unfriendly, which is exactly the opposite direction of what we like to take going forward to make it more growth friendly. Is it going to be 100% growth friendly? Probably not, difficult in the present circumstances but it doesn’t have to be very growth unfriendly in that it focuses on additional contributions on labor where the labor costs edge is already… which is already quite high and I adds to the corporate tax, which as we know is historically difficult to collect, in many countries but in Greece in particular. On the structural reforms, uh we are I think a bit short on many points but as I said, don’t want to go into the details of it unless we have the time to do the work and the three institutions can come to a fully… a very common view which is what we, um, intent to work towards. In terms of process, I’m very much looking forward to the teams sitting down, very promptly this afternoon in order to assess and measure the contributions of the proposals, identify the gaps, and see how it can be bridged. I think that needs to be done promptly. I’m not too sure that the next two day will be sufficient but I’m certain that it will not be sufficient to reach, what under IMF jargon we call a staff level agreement, which requires that there be a list of prior action, financing for the next 12 months, assurance of financing going forward, and a debt sustainability analysis which will be a factor of the current debt and possibly debt reparation. Having said that, I’m sure that alternative sequences can be envisaged and from our perspective we are very keen to sit down from 3 pm onwards and to hope that there is broad support in Athens for what is clearly a change of approach by the authorities.",2015-06-22 00:00:00,IMF
jeroen dijsselbloem,"Thank you very much. Um, Yanis, we started without you sorry. I wasn’t sure if you were very close or still very far. Someone asked how long it would take you to come by motorbike from Athens but luckily you were quite close. Uh so you’ve only missed a short part of the introduction by the commission um the three institutions have given a very first overview of your new proposal but of course I would like you to introduce them uh more uh and then well, we’ll see where we stand.",2015-06-22 00:00:00,EG President
yanis varoufakis,"Thank you very much, Jeroen. Uh thank you to the institutions. Let me get one thing completely straight in the response to Christine’s uh, comment about uh the smartness of strategic element in the way and the timing of the presentation. Christine, let me assure you that there was no strategic delay involved, the reason why you got it late was because we were working very, very hard. Colleagues, you have to understand that the kind of compromises that we have affected, that we have introduced to this… in this text are politically extremely difficult. It’s not simply a question of three or four of us sitting around a table and deciding them, uh the reason why there was uh a second version during the night, I was not aware there was a third, but I don’t believe there was a third, there was a second version during the night was because, uh, there was some technical details that had to be corrected. There was no, uh, political change in the middle of the night. Christine, uh you, you you you described the approach that we have taken as ‘smart’ and I suspect what you mean, uh and I think I’m faithful to the spirit in which you said it, is that we we we are trying to fudge, we are trying to stay within the institutions expectations of us but at the same time not to. This is how I understand, uh your, your uh, your point. Colleagues let me remind you that our guiding principal, and I think we all agree on that is the 20th_february Agreement. And let me remind you that it took three EuroGroups to reach that agreement, and the whole point of that agreement, especially if you read the text of 20th_february, was to establish common ground between the existing MOU, the existing program, and the new ideas this government was elected to pursue. This is precisely what we are doing now. So I believe that the approach we have taken is fully in the spirit of the 20th_february Agreement. We’re trying to find the common ground between a program which um in the um opinion of many, including some within the IMF I believe, has failed to achieve its targets, the targets that were set in 2012, uh there were various uh how shall I say? Um, failures, predicted failures that were involved in that program. There were clearly huge failures on the Greek side, in terms of implementation, in terms of achieving the growth targets that were set, and at the same time we need to stay within the framework but at the same- but bring up to the new set of circumstances and put together a reform package that we can push through the Greek parliament, push through your parliaments, through your governments, and make a success of it. So it is quite clear, and I welcome the view of the uh, other institutions as well as Christine’s, that this is a framework for reaching an agreement, for founding an agreement on, within it. Uh as you can see, we have made great strides at, uh, um, meeting the institutions all the way, in terms of the fiscal targets. In particular the primary surplus numbers of 1%, 2%, 3% and thereafter 3.5%. We have um put forward parametric measures, more than what was asked by the institutions. The institutions were asking for two and a half percent, we have over parametric measures of 2.8% by 2016. The difference here is that the VAT target that the institutions presented to us of 1%, we do not believe we can extract it parametrically without any improvements in collectibility. We believe that, on the basis of a pretty thorough uh meso-economic, partly micro-economic, partly macro-economic analysis, that the best we can do parametrically is about 0.75% uh of GDP through parametric measures. Now, there seems to me that there is a small incongruity here on the part of the institutions, in particular of the IMF, the argument that was being put to us as to why we need to simplify the VAT code, um, was that it increases collectibility. But when we agreed on that and we proposed a major simplification of the VAT code, we were asked to produce numbers parametrically, assuming that there is no improvement in collectibility. I just want to mention that as an indication of the, of the differences that still exist. But on the question of pensions, we have produced numbers that credibly promise more than 1%, just slightly, just above 1% of GDP in savings for the pension system. We propose to do it differently, instead of cutting pensions, we are proposing an increase in contributions by both uh, uh I’ll come to this in a minute. On top of that, we have undertaken significant defense cuts, cuts in defenses expenditure. And of course, other administrative measures which are very important, firstly because one of the great problems in Greece, as everybody knows, is the collection of tax is not so much tax rates and parametric values. On the question of uh, the growth friendliness that Christine mentioned, now this is of course the crucial key. It is a key that will unlock success for this program and for the future arrangements for the Greek economy. The point we wish to make is that we have accepted the fiscal numbers of the institutions fully cognizant of the fact that these numbers are recessionary, when in an economy like the one we have now, which is in recession, has never managed to get out of recession, even in 2014, at least in nominal terms. When you introduce 2.8% of measures this is by definition, not particularly growth friendly. We had to compute to estimate our different multipliers. So for instance, whether it is growth friendly or not, or relatively growth friendly compared to the institutions suggestions depends on whether you think, for instance, that reducing the lowest of the low of pensions has a smaller or larger multiplier effect comparing- compared to increasing corporate tax. But this is, this is an empirical matter and, and we can sit down of course with our technical teams and discuss this, uh this afternoon, until we’re each in agreement. More precisely on the pensions, because the pensions are very important, I think for all institutions, all three institutions, and for us. Um, we have determined and committed to introduce legislation immediately that dras… drastically limits early retirements beginning 1st of January. This coming January 2016. Uh to push the minimum age of retirement, effective retirement not formal retirement, at 67 by the year 2025. From this year, we’re proposing that anyone who goes on early retirement, using the provisions of existing law which cannot just be cut off from one day to the next, uh there will be a 10% surcharge effectively reduction their pension in the form of a contribution to their own pension fund. That’s on top of the existing 6% so there will be a 16% reduction in the, um, pension that will be receiving… in the take home pension in a sense. The solidarity acas tranche that Pierre mentioned before uh, we’ve agreed to begin replacing it in 2018, and to faze it out completely by 2020. By, within an appropriate framework compensating pensioners below the official poverty line. Uh at the same time, again in the context of pension reform and, and, and reaching that level of just above 1% of measures benefiting the pension system and its sustainability, we are proposing to increase the health contribution of those on supplementary benefits by 5% from 0%, which is now to 5%. To increase the social security contribution for those who are um not already enjoying a supplementary pension but who are working towards it, to increase it by half a percent of their salary, to harmonize contributions in the private… in the public sector and make them equivalent to those in the private sector that is a significant improvement in the finances of the pension funds, and of course to complete the consolidation of pension funds with an effective and important saving in the operating costs of pension funds by the 31st of September 2016. Now additionally we have other parametric measures uh that we are proposing as part of this document that was uh related to the institutions overnight, uh for instance I mentioned the defense cuts. We’re talking about immediate defense cuts of 200 million, uh, reforming the income tax code that involves capital taxation investment vehicles, farmers, and the self employed. Um the corporate tax increase from 26% to 29%, a permanent tax regime for advertisements in the media, in particular television that have been scandalously exempt from taxation so far. Um, an increased… a permanent increase in luxury tax on recreational vessels, uh taxation on VLT machines and gaming machines of 30% that was, that was an unregulated part of the market and therefore untaxed. Uh reforms in pharmaceutical rebates, uh, perhaps far more importantly in the long term. And this is something I’ve mentioned before here but I’d like to mention once again because it is a momentous change in Greece, and it is one that I would like you to… I would like to impress upon you how difficult it was to push through parliament or to imagine pushing it through parliament, we haven’t pushed it yet but we shall. That is the creation of a fully independent tax and customs authority, outside the Ministry of Finance along the lines of something like the IRS in the United States. Uh the fiscal council that will be monitoring the budget, an independent fiscal coun… uh, uh council with a possibility, as I mentioned in our last meeting, of trading off policy space of the Greek government with an automated uh deficit break. Regarding product market and administrative reforms that Christine mentioned, we have begun and announced formally a joint project with the OECD that will be, um, that is already being implemented and which spell out to the institutions in some detail. Just mention, let me mention the headlines here uh “An Anti-Corruption Drive through-out the Greek Bureaucracy and the Greek procurement mechanisms”, “Liberalization of the Construction Sector” which is an important sector country like this, especially as we are exiting the recession. “The Liberalization of the Wholesale Trade of Electronic Platforms” media as well as communications. Removing the red tape drastically from the licensing of businesses and introducing digitalized ‘one stop shops’. Uh pension system reform that is serious long term actuarial studies in conjunction with the OECD for the purposes of dealing with the problem of the system and ability of the pension system once and for all and not just through parametric measures. Uh, in conjunction with the OECD and the ILO, the design flexible collective bargaining agreement for the labor markets. In the realm of privatization, we have set out what is a realistic problem. Let me remind you, colleagues, that the last programs of privatization in Greece were scandalously um misjudged and ill designed. Remember the 50 billions that were supposedly to be collected through privatization when 1/50th was achieved in the end. We have set out a very realistic program for this year 1.4 billion, for 2016 3.7 billion, and for 2017 1.2 billion in a market where asset prices have collapsed. And let me now complete by saying that, colleagues, these of course are critical moments, there is very little time left, and we all have to move. We believe that our government has moved a long way towards a position of the institutions, we have accepted fiscal measures that in an economy which has uh not stopped shrinking with uh no functioning banking system in terms of credit provision with very little investment. In that kind of economy, we have accepted in order to bring about this agreement uh measures that are indeed recessionary. Even under fairly conservative estimates of fiscal multipliers, we’re going to have a significant reduction in aggregate demand. For this package of reforms, which we have exceeded in order to conclude successfully the final review of at least the European program. Setting for the moment aside for the moment the IMF program which we can discuss later which runs in parallel until March of 2016. For that program to have a chance of success, a chance of being viable, it must come together with investor confidence building announcement regarding financing. And by financing I don’t mean just an extension of the current loans, uh a… a new package of loans which is not sustainable and which adds uh new debt on existing unsustainable debt, I’m referring to an announcement that inspires a high probability estimate in the mind of investors, and citizens, and consumers that Greece is going to be out of the woods soon. That Greece is about to be fully integrated for instance in the ECB’s Quantitative Easing Program, that we’re not merely buying time until a few months later when we come back to this forum and have another discussion about the Greek Crisis. Neither you nor we want to go to our parliaments yet again, after we go now in order to solidify, in order to push through them the agreement that we are discussing today. This is why we’re very much in favor of completing the review now, completing the second program, uh, and establishing the measures that we are going to agree upon and which we are going to push through parliament as the common conditionality with uh an ease and facility that will allow uh for the transfer… the effective transfer of the 27 billion of the legacy debt from the SNP program into a more manageable debt repayment program so that we can have, on the one hand, our government accepting MOU, a revised MOU, with significant recessionary measures in it but also a flattening out, a smoothening out of the debt repayments to the SNP bonds for the next year, year and a half, two years, which runs against the grain of what we are agreeing to today which is a package of reforms that makes Greece sustainable again. For as the minimum condition to make this work, both financially in terms of the funding gap, in terms of a modicum of hope that Greece will re… will join Quantitative Easing uh is an SNP buy back to smoothen out the short term repayment schedule and to allow a degree of hope about participating in a program, the QE program, which let’s not forget was created in order to defeat deflation, and this is significant for a country which is in the throngs of deflation, probably the only country in the Eurozone today which is suffering a deflation rate of -2%. Surely I believe the institutions can see that. I have no doubt because I have heard this, I have discussed this with the good people of the IMF that this um balancing between an MOU that gives you what you need in order to seal the agreement with us and at the same time a minimum approach to the way that the debt must be managed more efficiently in order to make the MOU reforms potentially successful. This balancing act is essential for us in order to be able to seal this agreement and to say that the Euro Group, the uh Euro Summit later today, the Greek government, each one of you taking this… this package to your parliaments, we have signed and sealed a viable agreement for Greece. One that has considerable hope and a high probability of uh ensuring that we’re not back here in a few months time, discussing the same problem again. Thank you very much.",2015-06-22 00:00:00,Greece
jeroen dijsselbloem,"Thank you. Um, colleagues I think that um listening to the institutions. There are two ways to look at where we are, two ways to look at the proposals.  Uh was of course it’s only a first assessment because they came in only this morning, um, but I think Falda said was a good start for discussion, uh, Pierre told about… said it was a comprehensive package but more work needed to be done. Benoit called it the right framework for discussion and had many questions on substance and, uh, specificity, Christine, um, called it, after having said it was strategic and smart, she said there was some positive moves in there but also lacks specificity that doesn’t add up to  having said that I think for us the assessment of the institutions is crucial. First thing that would have to happen for us to be able to give our political judgment is to, uh, hear on that more definite assessment by the institutions and that would require still work with the Greek authorities uh which would start immediately today to get the specifics, to get the details, to ask the questions that need to be asked, to understand what the proposals are, and to work on a, in the end, a very concrete, very specific list of prior actions. So we can have the first round of political remarks or values now. Uh, but I think, on the basis of what we’ve heard from the institutions it’s crucial in the coming days, uh, highly concentrated work needs to be done. In order to see whether we can reach that agreement later this week. On the basis of what we have now, it is impossible to come to any final conclusions, that would be my assessment of where we are now.

Obviously there has been a move, and a move in the right direction in this  we need some space, not a lot of space, but we need at least now until Thursday, so that the institutions can do a full assessment and if possible come up with a set agreement and brief us on it in great detail. Um, At the conclusion of Yanis’ remarks he referred to SMP and the smoothing out of debt uh, the debt profile and the transfer of liabilities from the Central Bank to the ESM, uh, I wouldn’t have thought that was a runner but uh, I’d like to see the Central Banks assessment of that and uh the views of Klaus Rengling on that as well.

Um, there is some changes in the figures  so let me point out the channel, the institutions confer, that it is non-paper, this is why there is the flexibility we decided in February in our statement in the agreement with Greece. If it is in line, that’s probably the base for the discussions which are necessary in the next hour and days. But it if it’s not in line there will be much more than the flexibility that we agreed on February that must be dealt in discussion in between ministers of finance.

male,"Thanks Jeroen. Uh, I actually have a few questions to ask, rather than statements to make. The only statement I would make is  uh I have two questions. One question is to the institutions, I understand from your language and the adjectives you used in assessing state, that there are disagreements. So, uh, I wanted to go into the details of the disagreement in this room but of course as long as there is major disagreement among the institutions it’s very difficult, on the basis of that, to provide a political assessment. We must rely on a common view of the institutions, where they stand and whether there is milage to make going forward. So, this um, my second point which was… I mean to take up a point which uh here Pierre according to my notes made, and others: the prior action story. Let’s face it. We need to rebuild trust at a minimum level that allows us to move forward, and the extended prior actions are an instrument for more… more confidence. I would urge that these are put forward and met as this is directly, especially to Yanis and the Greek government, we value and need this or because if we don’t have it, let’s not hide ourselves, then really we’re wasting your time. Thank you.",2015-06-22 00:00:00,Unidentified
luis de guindos,"Thank you, Jeroen. First of all I am also happy that uh we have started to see some movement apparently in the right direction. I share the same view that uh, that uh, that uh, Pierre [Carlo with respect to how we have reached this situation. That we have started to comment and collaborate on potential uh capital controls. Um, well, how much time we have lost and how is it possible that we have reached this situation that we are on the verge of collapse. Uh, thirdly…well, we are… I don’t know what I have to tell my boss, you know for the meeting of today. Uh I can tell him that, you know, the institutions have a good impression about the recent proposal but that there is not a concrete uh uh assessment about the real situation. So, you know, immediately he is going to reply why have I been reconvened with the rest of the heads to this meeting? Why? And I think that this is a fair question, for, for, for everybody. And my concern is that we have generated expectations, I don’t know if you have seen the reaction of the markets today, the capital markets. But now, now, we, you know, someone is sending the signal that we are on the track. That I think that we are on the right track, a little bit late but apparently we are… we are on the right track. But uh uh uh, I think that we should be careful with creating this kind of expectations, because if there is one thing that should… everybody around this table should be aware is that markets over shoot. So the reactions today might be upset tomorrow in the other way around, and what we are keeping at the end of the day is only one thing: volatility. Volatility in the market place. So it’s something that we have to take into consideration and to bear in mind. And finally, as Pier Carlo and others, I would like to ask two questions. The first one is about debt reprofiling. We can call it, you know, semantics is very ample. But I would like to know, you know the proposals, are we thinking about any sort of restructuring of the debt? Is there any proposal in that direction? And the second one, also for this  implements all the measures uh that uh you know this plan the full implementation of this plan will imply any additional funding for the Greek authorities?",2015-06-22 00:00:00,Spain
jeroen dijsselbloem,"Okay, thank you. Um, perhaps we can first… Ah, Michel. If anyone else wants to the floor, please let me know. Michel. Thank you and  as far as we can and today. Yanis.",2015-06-22 00:00:00,EG President
yanis varoufakis,"Thank you very much Jeroen. Colleague we’re working through the night and during the day towards a good agreement. We have a duty to complete it quickly. Today’s an important day. The Euro summit is going to prove crucial in creating the mood for establishing the framework within which we are going to, be able to do the technical work, speed it up towards this goal, this collective goal. I was asked by Wolfgang a very straightforward question and I need to give… the duty to give a straightforward answer. You asked me, Wolfgang, whether the Greek government is ready and willing to impose capital controls. Our view, let me make this crystal clear, is that there is no need whatsoever for capital controls as long as we are successful in bringing about this agreement. The Greek public has shown immense calmness despite being bombarded both by the Greek media, by the foreign media, by us politicians with a great deal of insecurity and a great deal of almost terrorizing news regarding bank closures, capital controls, and so on. The moment we, the politicians, the technocrats, our leaders announce that an agreement has been stuck, there will be no need for capital controls. But beyond that, let me remind you that Greece is not an Island with a single airport without common borders, with the rest of the European continent, capital controls will be almost impossible to implement properly. Uh, and going down that road is going to unleash forces, which I do not believe that any one of us can be confident that we can control. On the question that… another question that was asked about the midterm financing effectively: this is a very serious, uh, reform agenda, that we’re discussing, this MOU that we have, uh, renegotiating and hopefully we shall conclude either today or tomorrow or maybe as Michael said by Wednesday or Thursday. Um, is a very difficult package for us politically and I have no doubt that it’s a very difficult package for you to, all of us will have difficulty pushing it through a parliament. It should end the crisis. It should be the last time you have to do this and we have to do this. But in order to be able to do this, we need to look at the repayment schedule, which is, this was designed, let me remind you a long, long time ago before the uh, fiscal numbers and the growth numbers were derailed after 2012 the proposal that we’re putting forward is really very simple. Once we are happy with the conditionalities, once we agree on the conditionalities, once we have a time table for prior actions as uh Pierre Carlos said we should embed this within a framework that makes sense and gives it the air of a sound public finance, which is necessary in which not to suffocate. So the point here is very simple. Let me just describe it once more but very succinctly. The idea is that we have these 27 billion sitting on the books of the ECB which are preventing us from returning to the markets. Market access is what we promise at the end of every agreement. Without QE, Greece will find it very difficult, it will be actually a cruel irony if the only country that needs it so badly is the one that is excluded from it. The only way we can do this is by without going to our parliament again in a few months time or in a year’s time. And meanwhile losing this opportunity of taking ad- advantage of a program which will not last forever if we don’t jump on the bandwagon of QE, now we are going to, to, to, to miss out on this. So the proposal is this. The MOU that we are negotiating should be of course the basis for completing the current review, the fifth review, and at the same time that completes the European program. We have a new agreement with loan arrangement with the ESM using the same conditionality, not one new Euro for the Greek government in terms of spending of using, the new ESM agreement or the same conditions allows us to do to perform an SMP by back from the ECB, retire those bonds, the SMP profits, which will be something like around nine billion can be dispersed in doses with reviews every time that so that the implementation of the MOU is monitored properly and on top of that we can have an agreement as part of this same arrangement that Greece’s participation in QE, which will have been made possible by this agreement is also conditional on the reviews of a regulatory views of the implementation of the MOU. Colleagues. The only reason why I’m tiring you this is because we need to answer the question, how do we make this MOU that we’re describing the set of conditionalities not only politically feasible, but also how can we create a space in the midterm for public financial intervention that can make it breathe work so that this Euro Group is not saddled yet again in a few months time with more crunch meetings like this one.",2015-06-22 00:00:00,Greece

What I proposed was exactly what you said: that the same conditionalities to be used for a new loan arrangement so that the Greek government borrows that money from the ESM, uses it to buy back the SMP bonds to retire them and therefore the liability is effectively transferred from the ECB to the ESM. It will be a new program, it will be a new loan according to the constitution to the charter of ESM, but there will be the same conditionality that we are agreeing upon these days.",2015-06-22 00:00:00,Greece

christine lagarde,"Thank you very much.  the other two institutions which, clearly is most helpful way forward in view of the urgency, of the market  Second point, I want to answer a couple of questions that have been raised because I don’t want to mislead members of the Euro Group and I want them to understand, what what and why we’re doing certain things. The famous aide memoire has been put together by the three institutions and certainly constitutes a dilution or watering down, a loosening of what was in the memorandum. And that is not very unusual given the way we have to operate. When we do a review of the program, and the situation have changed, the perspectives have changed, the team is different. You might have to adapt to the new reality and integrate this new universe into the program. That’s what we do on most, reviews that we conduct. So under the circumstances it’s completely clear that in order to make progress towards one day, satisfactory review, we have to adjust. So that’s what it is, it’s watered down, it’s diluted, it was sens- sensible to actually do that because of that new reality. And it does include hard, difficult steps, significant structural reforms. Not all of them, but adjustments to the reality, which is the reason why in the area of financing, which for the IMF has to be very clear and specific for the next 12 months. More will be needed, and we’ll probably include some debt re-profiling, which, if we stick with the, me- with the aide memore as it is, we’ll not require haircuts. So, I’m completely open and transparent with you as to what steps we have to take. In case of change of circumstance. That’s what it is.",2015-06-22 00:00:00,IMF

jeroen dijsselbloem,"Thank you. I’m going to try and uh, come to conclusions. Now first conclusion, would that there can be no, conclusion, on the basis of the information that we have been given today. Um, you must realize that’s the fact that there is a summit tonight and it’s a decision that was supposed to be taken elsewhere. Uh, but if there is a summit, then we must prepare it. We have to try to do so today, but given the information we have now and the, late added proposals and the work the institutions still have to do on that, It’s impossible to have a final . Having said that, that is also an advice to the, uh to the summit tonight that’s where we stand now, it will be impossible to come to an agreement today. Second point would be that many of you have said, I would like to analyze that. We do welcome the new proposals. We feel that it is a possible step in the right direction. I think those are the words many of you have used. Yet. The proposals will have to be assessed very specifically. If there are any gaps they must be filled. Uh, and it will have to be translated in a very concrete prior action list which can be delivered in a very short period. That prior action list is also a chance to fill in any gaps to make concrete  and to deliver specifics where needed. That work and so I’ve also understood from the institutions, can start immediately and also Yanis refer to that  from that. And we welcome that, thank them for all their efforts. That work can start immediately with a view to reach if possible a final agreement, likely this week. It also means in my mind will get such results is successful,. Is possible that we will have extra Eurogroup before council’s meeting. Two other points: first, some of you have asked the financing needs, and others have mentioned debt. Financing needs, and I think we will have to come back to that later this week, depends of course, on how tough and concrete the final deal is. Uh, so we will also have to ask the institutions to come back on that issue to us, if we have an extra Eurogroup this week. On debt: if the Greek government puts that forward, as pre-condition, having deep dept reconstructuring and haircut . We’ve discussed this may times in the Euro Group I know the  And is, and has always been along the lines, of this  and the program has been on track for almost a year now and uh it’s not complete. Secondly, uh the second element in our stage  uh. And that promise from November, 2012 was quite clear. I don’t see a lot of political space to change that way. Arguing and making moves now or promises now in terms of debt reprofiling or debt restructuring at this point would certainly make a deal impossible. That’s my political assessments.

The reason why the recession has deepened in the last months is, as Mario said, a combination of uncertainty and lack of credit.

Uh, well, we have seen the reaction of the market. Uh, tomorrow, I think that we will have, uh, you know, the inverse evolution and performance of the markets. I am not concerned about that. I am surely concerned about volatility the market plays, no, because, uh, I have suffered that, uh, uh, you know, as minister of finance of Spain, you know, in 2012, no? And I know what that does mean for, uh, you know, a government, and for a country.

Uh, well, uh, I think that it’s very clear that the combination of uncertainty and lack of credit can create a recession, but also can make a dent in the credibility of the solutions. I’m not, uh, concerned about, uh, you know, being convinced without, uh, you know, any definitive conclusion to a meeting like this.

Second point, you already anticipated, uh, I would like to plea that this group is convened, not just when there is a final solution, but when there is some probability of solution. This is not because, like everybody else, we’re a bit concerned about flying back and forth, which can be nice, but because there is an additional risk which I am beginning to spot, that the Eurogroup may lose credibility if we keep meeting without making progress. And of course, this, beyond a specific point we’re discussing today, is very important for the credibility of the, of the Eurozone going forward. My final point is about prior access. Uh, I fully share Christine’s list of features that should be, accompany prior actions, credible, fair, growth friendly, sustainable. Of course, prior actions are there to show, not just that, uh, a country is able to, uh, implement a policy that is needed, it is also willing to do so. Uh, as I said last time, we are badly running out of time, and we’re probably badly running out of trust, which is possibly even worse.

edward scicluna,"Okay, thanks, uh, Jeroen. Just one sort of observation/question on the process and then one quick comment on, on the substance. Just in the process, I mean, I, I of course find it exciting that I’ve been at three Eurogroups, uh,  for six days. Uh, and, and, I was wondering how you plan to take this forward because what I see happening now is that, we’ll interrupt this meeting here, let the institutions of Greece work over a document, then we reconvene here in the morning. But I am not convinced, politically, that there will be a deal tomorrow morning, and perhaps… And this is more, uh, a question to Yanis… is there sort of a, some kind of guarantee that, uh, if your Prime Minister doesn’t wanna bring it up in the European Council one more time, which would then mean that we would probably have to reconvene on Friday evening? Why do I say Friday evening? Because there needs to be a deal by Saturday morning, so that it can be then pushed, possibly, through the Greek parliament, so that it can then be approved by our parliaments. So that would basically mean that we would have, I don’t know, four, five, even six Eurogroups, within approximately eight days. Now, um, I don’t know, some people mentioned, and I think, correctly, the credibility, uh, of the Eurogroup, in, in, in this whole process and, and how we look. That’s one side of the story. The other side of the story is, is what Mario was talking about, basically market reaction because now we’re going back and, and, and forth. So I just wanted to ask you, Jeroen, how you plan to take it forward and also just some kind of a rain check from Yanis, on, on whether there is an attempt to push it one more time, uh, to the summit, uh, meeting, which I, I don’t think in and of itself would be helpful. But  I think that’s what’s gonna happen. Finally, on substance, I agree fully with what, for instance, Wolfgang said, uh, also what Hans Jörg said. I think we should stick to February 20. I think we need clear prior actions, we need commitments and, and conditionality. I don’t think that has changed. I’m just feeling .",2015-06-24 00:00:00,Malta

Um, now, over the last week starting on Friday, with the events themselves, are putting into question our own credibility now. The ability of the Eurozone and the institutions . So we have to be really careful in, in delineating where we go from here, even about the meeting you have tomorrow. I think the litmus test of the negotiations tonight, shouldn’t be what Greece wants or what we want, and so on, but how are we going to be seen to the world outside? The financial markets, are they going to be better? If that title is, uh,  discuss, is it a good idea to say, “Let’s meet tomorrow,” because we can’t meet today because we don’t have the confidence.

christine lagarde,"Thank you Jeroen. Um, I’m going to repeat other’s work but I think this issue of speaking consecutively to say that there is nothing substantial to discuss is really bad, uh, and when I was told that there would be a meeting today my first question was, “Is there enough time for a proposal to be discussed?” The answer I received was, “There has to be.” Ah, and the priority is not, and given that this has happened twice, I think it’s very  agreement, list of directions, um, a common position by the three institutions, all the preconditions in mind with the, uh, statement of February. But in terms of process, this is clearly not going well. Um, I know that this is no one’s intention, but I think that our whole credibility, of all of us is really on the line. I think institutions that we  say that there will be a meeting tomorrow because, if there is, ready or not, there should be a decision no matter what. We should not let ourselves be in a position to meet for a third time to conclude that there is nothing to conclude. That the loss of credibility is way too damaging for us all. It’s hurting Greece, it’s hurting everyone else and it’s leading nowhere. And if we get to an agreement at a later stage, and it’s clear to us whether this is final, whether we will reconvene again and decide something else, so I really urge for us to think whether it makes sense to meet tomorrow morning.

pierre moscovici,"Thank you Jeroen. Um, I will be very brief because I think most things have been said. Uh, but I underline that what is on the line here is, uh, obviously not only the problems that Greeks and the Greek governmental people have, but it’s the credibility of the Eurogroup and the credibility of the Eurozone and in the end credibility of the Euro. I have this strange feeling which we cannot even communicate to the outside world that we have basically not a lot, not a lot to say if not to say, nothing to say at all, because we don’t have documents in front of us. This is not a criticism to the three institutions. I think they are doing a wonderful job. But the time has come where we we, we must know what’s on the table for the good sake of this negotiation. I think  in a minute. And, last but not least, uh, I really think we need to be honest amongst ourselves to which extent we want to have a deal. So, in other words, what is the scope of the deal that we’re talking about? Are we talking about, what I call the very short term deal, which deals with problems of liquidity and finishing the, the program, and just prolonging it for a, for a few weeks so that we can do the payments? Is that what we are expecting tomorrow, or whenever? Or are we expecting something larger. So if we are expecting something larger, then obviously the answer is, we are in no position to, to, to give any green light to anything that requests additional money. What we are discussing, I think, or that was my understanding is, that we’re in the framework of the 20th_february agreement and so that’s still the state of mind I have but I hear that lots of other ideas are on the table and they were also mentioned on Monday, but we have never discussed them here and I think they cannot really be so I would say, as a conclusion, we can only meet tomorrow, eventually, in the afternoon, if before that we get a piece of paper that we would have a couple of hours to study, and make up our own minds, and be sure this is it. It’s all short-term solutions, which we need. And other issues are postponed for later or are not discussed yet. But I would like enough clarity on this last point because, if we are still hoping, or some are still hoping, that we’re going to have something that goes beyond the very short term, I’m pretty sure there is no way we can find a solution.",2015-06-24 00:00:00,European Commission

It’s becoming embarrassing that we’re relying on media leaks for the base documents, um, this Eurogroup is supposed to make decisions. We generated the document of the 20th_february ourselves, and that’s the only legal document that I have agreed to so far. We had one more, which was the subject of much speculation, and there were legal reasons why it wasn’t circulated, and I appreciate those legal reasons, but the aide memoire has become a document on which a counter document from Greece has been made. And it has gone on now, seemingly, to become the basis for a negotiating document, uh, which I haven’t seen or which I do  with another copy in the Financial Times website, uh, where the amendments proposed by the institutions are in red print and the base documents are in black print and there are 96 other amendments. I don’t know whether that means they’re no longer being pressed or whether they’ve been agreed by our finance ministers, who are key to the decision making process. This is no way to do business. And, uh, in the morning, I expect full documents because I’m not prepared to make decisions on narratives, no matter how, uh, succinct and full the narratives are. I need to see the written documents of what we’re agreeing to. The longer it goes on, the more full the proposal needs to be. We’d probably have got away with another instalment of extend and pretend if we had come to this point a couple of months back. But I think extending and pretending now ’til October or November is not enough, and at least there has to be a mapping out of what the route is forward after that, for Greece. And, uh, whether that’s part of the agreement with that or not, I don’t know. I would also like to have legal opinion in the morning for our meeting, and that the aide memoire runs legally from its parent, the par- the, the, the statement of the 20th_february. And the negotiating document runs in a direct leading line from the statement of the 20th_february through the aide memoire including the counter proposals of Greece down to what’s been presented in the document.

jeroen dijsselbloem,"Thank you. Um, allow me to pick up on a couple of points that you’ve made. First of all, how the process has evolved over the last weeks. Of course in previous meetings a number of you colleagues have said you refuse to be involved, be involved more, which is a quite right point because of developments followed through the media. If we hadn’t met to discuss. Now we are meeting more often than we would like, to be involved. The difficulty is that there are no final results to present to you. So there is a dilemma here. Um, how has the process evolved? I think Michael described it in quite a good way, how the different documents have been following each other up. Documents which you have not had. This is very unfortunate, but it has to do with our working method. Course it’s extremely unfortunate that the documents are available to the press. It’s really embarrassing. Looking back, ah, last couple of weeks, uh, three institutions have worked on a common position, and after that agreed to present it for the first time, quite a comprehensive set of proposals, at nine pages. Which was a positive step, as opposed to how we discussed it here. Also we realized that the institutions had not been able to give a more thorough assessment of those proposals to see how close they were to the framework which we agreed. That work has been done over the last couple of days. At the same time, the Greek authorities have presented a list of prior actions. Not only did we, the institutions, come to the assessment that there were still a number of problems in the nine pages, to answer Gutchen, these problems are along the line fiscal gaps, so the Greek authorities said they could agree to the proposed, by the institutions proposed, not agreed by us yet. But by the institutions proposed new fiscal targets and timelines. The authorities have said we could agree to those. But then the methods have to add up to those. So there were fiscal gaps. Secondly, the analysis of three institutions jointly was that in terms of credible reforms, where does the growth come from? It’s not  too much has been reversed, or postponed, not complete enough. It will not lead to enough growth. Thirdly, the balance in the package that we were discussing, the balance between, ah, tax increase, expenditure cuts, once again growth harming tax increases was too much of a tax hike. So it needs to become more growth friendly, or less growth unfriendly. So these are the main problems that we are  that we are, um, so the nine page proposal from the Greek government was assessed and showed these problems. A list of prior actions then proposed by the Greek government deviate, deviated even more from where we want to end.",2015-06-24 00:00:00,EG President

jeroen dijsselbloem,"In other words, instead of converging, ah, to an agreement which fits in the  20th_february, we were over the last couple of days diverging from it. That must be the case. Today we have gone through these proposals. Um, we have not been able to close that gap. *I’ve listened* very carefully to you today, and have reaffirmed the statement of the 20th. Absolutely clear that we cannot diverge from it. You have made clear that, uh, the current situation can be no talk of debt restructuring, etcetera. Uh, Wolfgang added there can be no additional money. No fresh money. Very clear. That’s the basis that we must work on in order to propo- to bring to you proposals that are valid. That have a chance of getting your approval. It takes a lot more time than, uh, we would like. It’s getting a lot more media coverage than is helpful. And it is putting a great strain on your agendas, ah, to which I apologize, ah, but this is where we are. Now on the issue of tomorrow, I think there are two options. We can say that we adjourn temporarily this meeting and reopen it tomorrow. We can also say that only on the basis of what is there tomorrow, we will call a new meeting. But some of you would have said that you would also like to be informed, and maybe talk about different scenarios if there is no agreement. So, we’ve been assigned to the government leaders in the council to try to, try and get that agreement, and then report to them tomorrow. That is still the assignment that we have. I think we should give an ultimate attempt, tonight, all through the night, to try and get the convergence that we need. To land inside the framework of the 20th. That is how I see our task in the coming hours, ultimate attempt to do that. I c- would like to ask you to stay in Brussels and be available so we can continue our work. I think that would be wise more-so as a signal to the outside world that we are still in the process. Uh, but I would need your support. It would have to be a common decision of all of us. Um, ah, I think it was Pierre who said we would need some hours to look at any proposals. We need to prepare, and I think that’s a fair point. So we could set our meeting perhaps later in the morning, so you have that time, under the assumption that over the course of the night we hammer out all the differences that are still there. I am in this space very strongly involved. I vouch for the institutions, the work that they are doing, jointly. Their analysis of where we are, and the Greek proposals has been the same between the three of them. The adjustments that we need has been delivered by the three institutions together. I think this is very important. I will remain very involved over the coming hours and days. But unfortunately, this is where we are and I think it is inevitable that between now and the summit, which starts tomorrow afternoon at 5:00, to which we have to report, that you remain available, either to take stock, hopefully, of good proposals, concrete papers that you have asked. Michael has made quite clear he needs those papers to come to any decision. Or to take stock the situation if not. Because I think it was  he also needs to talk if there is no agreement tomorrow.

yanis varoufakis,"Oh, ah, from the Greek side, as well, we would prefer to have the meeting, to hold the meeting as late in the day as possible, to give us more time to prepare. So I agree with most colleagues who have spoken on this. Ah, allow me to say that, ah, on the question of, ah, growth-friendly policies, since this has been mentioned and this is central to the issue at hand, my government is absolutely committed to them. But let me make the brief point that when you have a shrinking economy and we agree on two and half percent of GDP of extra measures. This is not in itself a particularly growth-friendly ah, posture. The difference of opinion is empirical. It’s not ideological. Do you get greater forces of recession by reducing the pensions of the lowest of the low of pensions, or do you get more recession when you increase tax on corporate tax? This is an empirical issue. This is not a dogmatic issue. Regarding prior actions and the SLA, of course, you have to have in front of you tomorrow, we all do, very specific text including prior actions. We hove worked on this. We have tabled our own version. Our own proposal and prior actions. It’s a question of coming to an agreement with the institutions on this. On the broader question, let me say colleagues that we feel, just like you do, perhaps more than you do, the pressure to end this conversation successfully to complete the review as quickly as possible. We more than you, for obvious reasons. But let me also add that maybe it is better to have the sequence of, ah, tedious meetings, than to have a situation where we hatch up an agreement which is not sustainable and which leads all of us to come back to this room six months, eight months, nine months, 12 months from now. That would harm the credibility of the institutions and the Eurogroup and each one of us even more. Finally, Alexander, you asked a question. You asked a question about whether my Prime Minister has an intention of deferring to the leaders, to the summit tomorrow night. Let me assure you that our government is determined to strike an agreement as quickly as possible with the institutions, hopefully tonight, so that our Eurogroup meeting is as profitable as possible. We do not have a strategy of deferring to other fora. We do not have a strategy for delaying. Thank you.",2015-06-24 00:00:00,Greece
jeroen dijsselbloem,"Let me make two points before I turn to Pierre. First of all, the leaders in their meeting were absolutely clear that they will not endorse any outcome if the Eurogroup has not previously agreed to it.

jeroen dijsselbloem,"Thank you, no to, to Yanis to hear his perception of where we are.",2015-06-25 00:00:00,EG President
yanis varoufakis,"Thank you Jeroen. As a everyone knows this is uh, this has been a very laborious process. It has been uh, variously um, difficult and sometimes uh, unpleasant. Uh, I have to concur on this but the unpleasantness should not um, deter us from looking at what we have achieved. If you compare the two documents, the document that is in front of you by the Institutions and our document, you’ll find that they are very close. I believe that especially if you take into consideration where we started from and you compare it with where we are, convergence is the only word that comes to mind. We have converged on primary balance uh, targets uh, for the near and medium term. We have uh, exactly the same fiscal baselines scenarios after quite a lot of deliberation on this. For 2015 an 2016. As a result of this coincidence of primary balances and the fiscal baseline scenario uh, we have um, convergence, complete convergence on uh our estimates of fiscal gaps for 2015 and 2016. There have been a multitude of uh, agreements uh. Most recently it was uh, recommended to use that we should uh, introduce a tax on shipping and ship owners in Greece. Something that previous governments would never have done. Uh, we were grateful to the Institutions for having made that suggestion. It strengthened us and we have adopted it. So this is just one example of last minute convergence. Uh, our government has um, only two sticking issues picking up the point that uh, Pier made about the two major issues that consumed countless hours of deliberations and negotiations uh. VAT reform on the one hand and pensions on the other. We have proposed uh, a major VAT reform, V-A-T reform. Uh, the estimated yield from that reform comes to 1.7 billion a year, or almost one percent, 0.93% of GDP. We are proposing to um, have a lower rate of six percent just for pharmaceuticals, books and theatrical performances, we have a tradition in Greece of subsidizing the theatre um, a mid-level rate 13%, which is where most the food goes uh, energy, utilities I should say more generally, and uh, hotels which as you can imagine in Greece are a very important part of the economy. And then to um, to, to, to, to 23% which is a top rate, we put everything else. It took a long time for uh, our technical teams to devise a model that we could use as a common model by which to estimate the impact of different tax rates upon um, our uh, V-A-T take, and this is uh, I consider this to be a successful endeavor on the part of the institutions and us of establishing this common ground uh, in at least in terms of the analysis. Uh, the institutions requested um, that we should get a little bit more than 0.93, t-t- they requested one percent of GDP in extra VAT. We are very close to this. The point I want to make regarding VAT, and I think that this is a point that collogues will take well, it is meant well, is that one of the great problems we have in Greece is um, collectability. Our collectability rates are very low. We’ve had a very uh, bad track record on this and this is where we would want, and this is where we want an AMAT focusing our efforts in order to increase our VAT take. As you all know, when you’re attempting to increase collectability, increase in tax rates and pushing whole categories of goods and services onto the higher tax rate, is not helpful. So there is question here of whether the emphasis of reform should be on changing the tax rate, harmonizing the tax rate or actually on the tax collection system itself. We believe that it is the latter which will bring in much greater revenues than those estimated but we did not agree with institutions on how to compute, to calculate, to estimate the improvements the different reforms in the tax administration system would have. Um, on the pension system. The institutions demanded uh, a one percent of GDP improvement in the fiscal impact of our pensions system. We have delivered that. We have delivered it in a way which differs from that was, that which was proposed by the institutions, so we are increasing contributions to the pensions’ system together with the drastic elimination of early retirements. The institutions would prefer reductions in the actual pensions rather than increases in contribution. Uh, we are also proposing that is quite significant uh, to our gov- to our gover- to our parliament, we are ready to propose to our parliament uh, that the institutions’ uh, suggestion, that we harmonize contributions between the different funds, in particular between the private sector and the public sector funds, goes ahead at the cost of public sector employees who will have to increase their contributions. Um, product markets, some product markets, product market reforms, we have agreed upon. Others, we have maintain differences. Let me say collogues at this stage I don’t intend to speak for very long Jeroen, but I do think it is important to mention that this government has shifted a great deal. On almost every front we’ve crossed what we considered originally to be our red lines. What we are asking for, as you can see or hear from what I just said, was a degree of policy space. Christine referred to maximum flexibility, we don’t see that the institutions have applied maximum flexibility. We have applied a lot more flexibility, we’ve bent over backwards effectively in order to come closer or very close to institutions’ position. I believe that uh, in, both in the case of Ireland and the case of Portugal, the institutions showed a great deal more flexibility than um, in what we have experienced over the last few days. And let me just finish by focusing on perhaps the most significant aspect of our disagreement, of the reason why we have not achieved complete convergence yet. The list of prior actions that we are presenting to you, in the document that you have in front of you, is a very difficult set of reforms for us. It would be very hard for us politically in an economy which is experiencing seven years of unending non-stop contraction of nominal GDP, to introduce measure of two and a half percent of GDP and parametric ones on top of that other non-parametric ones. There is no doubt that especially in view of the dysfunctionality of our banking system as they are over-laden by NPLs. That these prior actions are certainly going to be recessionary. We tried to make them redistributive in a way that is closer to our program. Our program did not envisage such recessionary measures but accepted them. We accepted them to the full magnitude that was request of us. But we have slanted them in a manner which is redistributed, re- redistributive um, in, uh, harmony with uh, our political priorities. We are prepared to take such an SLA, such a set of prior actions through parliament and do it efficiently and quickly. But we are going to face a great deal of discontent, not only from our own government members of parliament but throughout the parliament house. And the question that we will be asked as ministers in parliament is: you want to ask to pass these prior actions, these are difficult ones for an economy in recession. What are you offering us? Do you envisage that as part of this agreement there is clear sight of an escape from the debt deflationary cycle. That, that we can say that Greece in the next few months can look forward to coming out of the woods, so to speak, of the crisis. The problem, collogues, is that as you, many of you said yesterday in this very room, that this is a set of prior actions that is the foundation for an extension of the program by a few months. Let’s say until the end of the year. Which of course means in the mind of any rational investor that they will think, okay, so another set of negotiations is going to be come to, to, to, to kick in, in November, another set of headlines full of uncertainty and full of concerns about Grexit and about this and that. I submitted to you colleagues that this kind of extension is simply going to, after a few days of buoyancy in the markets, as a result of having come to an agreement. Very, very soon after that, investors are going to be in suspended animation, they’re going to be waiting to see what happens towards the end of the extension. An economy which is already in a recession and introduces these heavily recessionary measures. Because Let’s face it: two and a half percent, what, however redistributed within the Greek social economy, they are going to be recessionary. Without having a clear view ahead, with these bumpidy payments of the SMP bonds as they are approaching, without any, um, serious discussion of our proposal, which involves absolutely no new money for Greece. Many colleagues mentioned here no new money for Greece. We did not suggest new money for Greece. We suggested an operation involving the ESM, which is perfectly legal which we could agree to it now uh, in such a way as to smoothen out the repayment schedule, the bumpy lumpy SMP repayments over the next year or two, which is the time during which this economy has to achieve escape velocity, so that you and I do not come back here at the end of December with another set of conditionalities, another round of negotiations, another set of meetings perhaps to go again to our parliaments, again to face political pressure both in Greece and in your own polity. Our hope was that we would be able to agree on prior actions that would be hard for us but which unleash us from the shackles of this never ending cycle of debt deflation. But even at this late, late stage I’m conveying to you our government’s determination to reach the common ground which we set out to reach on the 20th_february, as per the communique. I believe that any impartial spectator or observer looking at the documents will come to the safe conclusion that we don’t have the right as a Eurogroup not to reach an agreement today, thank you.",2015-06-25 00:00:00,Greece

There’s no way it would work. I could continue again and again and again and I have about seven major changes of the MOU. If you would follow these two papers, and I would have to ask for any of these major changes to be accepted in the German parliament. Do you really imagine that that would work? Therefore I could strongly argue an answer . And I can’t imagine that I can convince my parliament to accept the part of seven changes in the agreement.

luis de guindos,"Thank you uh, Jeroen, I’m going to make just a general comment, think that it uh, doesn’t make to much sense to enter into discussion on these measures because I think that we are not done. But I think that we have a real problem. We have a real problem because on the one side we have a political indication that was produced uh, last Monday uh, to do whatever it takes in order to reach an agreement. And to, we have created the expectation that uh, uh, you know is uh, is going to be how is uh, is uh you know the political agreement is going to have the upper hand in the discussions, that will you know I can share this view that this uh, of paramount importance to maintain uh, Greece in the Eurozone, and that we have to reach an agreement before the deadline that we have set that is the end of this month. So that’s the general perception in the marketplace and  I don’t know if you have uh, heard uh, different analysis and different research over the last days but uh everybody say you know at the end of the day you know the political agreement is going to prevail. But on the other hand, on the other hand, well I’m taking into consideration the different red lines that I am not going to assess in detail, well we have uh, seen that the technical, the technical analysis that’s not adapt that uh take into consideration the red lines of uh, of uh, Yanis. Of the IMF, of uh, you know the, the, the, the DSA the, the financing gaps uh, that you know, we are not going to be able to reach a technical, a technical agreement. I think that this is a very dangerous situation, a very dangerous situation, and I think that uh, well we have to know and we have to decide to go up to what part uh, of the discussion of this dilemma, is going to prevail at the end of the day. Otherwise, otherwise I think that we are going to continue in a sort of stalemate situation. We are going to dent and hurt the credibility of the Eurogroup and we are not going to, to to, to, to, to be able to find a viable solution both for Greece and for us.",2015-06-25 00:00:00,Spain

alexander stubb,"Thank you, Jeroen, I have one general, one specific and one question. The general remark is that I have always been a strong supporter of European integration and I think the Euro single market is probably one of the greatest achievements that we have ever done in the European Union. I’ve always been a very strong institutionalist. I think its great that the European Central Bank has exclusive competence on monetary policy and I, I think its great the European Commission has a sole right to initiative and I’ve never been a big fan of inter-governmentalism  some people are saying the we’re losing credibility perhaps, some people are saying we may ping pong back in forth perhaps, but the bottom line is that the longer we let this go on the more people will lose confidence, especially the markets. Uh, in our currency, and I don’t know how to get out of this one, uh, I mean I guess people are talking about two options. One is option A which is some kind of flexibility on conditionality uh, perhaps some kind of discussion of a way out from this dilemma. That will probably weaken the credibility of the Euro. The other one is a plan B. An exit of one of the members of the Eurozone now in the short term immediate term that would probably cause a lot of political and market turbulence. A lot of turbulence in the European project in general, but some say perhaps in the long term it would actually strengthen our common currency. Now I, I really don’t know how we’re gonna get out of, of this one but all I’m trying to say is that the longer we prolong this, to take it to the 11th hour on the 30th of June, the worse of I think all of us are. Now on the specifics, and I say this as a very strong pro-European much like Wolgang. Wolfgang looked at seven differences in changes from the memorandum of understanding. And I have a tendency to agree with those, I’d probably a notch a tiny little notch softer but saying that I simply don’t have a mandate to make a move. Especially on the financing side uh, on the repayments from the EFSF that’s just one example and I think  etcetera, etcetera. Uh, sometimes the debate seems to be a little one sided but I agree with all of those including Hans and Luis who said you know we have to sell this at home. Uh, and, and, and what is on the table now  institutions might be very difficult to sell it at home and that’s why I come to my questions or point is how, how do we take this forward from here? Because I think it would benefit all of us to, to, to end this as soon as possible. And, and how do you Jeroen..and I, I really don’t envy you in this task, how do you see these next hours panning out because we’re seriously, seriously running out of time and we are seriously making um, I think, yeah. We, we the problem is we’re not increasing credibility of the Euro nor our Eurogroup as such. And by the way I’ll come back to what I said yesterday. Yeah, I’ll ask the Greeks then. Yanis how do you propose to take this forward? Because I made the question, I asked the question yesterday, is there a willingness to take this to the Eurosummit at the 11th hour, basically meaning that the Euro, European Council ends at dinner and there’s another Eurosummit and then once again we convene tomorrow night or Saturday or Sunday uh, and try to find a solution. But uh, I mean we really need to, we need to make a decision now. I think patience is running out at all ends. Sorry for putting it so.",2015-06-25 00:00:00,Finland

michael noonan,"Thanks very much uh, Jeroen. I don’t have a lot to add to uh, what’s been said already. I thank you personally for distributing uh, documents that we are now working on. Documents are always very important. And we’re all on the same documents and on the same page and on the same sentence, which avoids misunderstanding the perspective positions now. I  the document generated by the Greek government as well. Which I got just before the meeting. And uh, it’s good to have that on the table. And I uh, would agree with Yanis to say that there’s a lot of convergence between the two positions. That they’re almost at the point of convergence. On the first reading of the documents I thought the two sides were quite far apart on essential issues and if I could trouble you again Jeroen to generate another document and would it be possible for the secretary to uh, amalgamate the two documents on the team by team, topic by topic basis. And uh, on the sentence by sentence show what the institution position is and what the Greek counter proposal is. And then we’ll see very quickly what degree of convergence there is. Of what degree of acceptance of positions there is. Second point id like to make is that uh I don’t that the uh, sustainability analysis paper adds up. Uh, there’s a phrase in it about a three year program financed with concessional financing. I have no idea what that means, no idea what that means. And uh, I’d like to see uh documents specify but my first advice um, staff is that the debt sustainability document needs more work. I personally believe it’s flawed and doesn’t for me add up and there are concepts included in it that I’m not quite clear on.  and there’s one common factor always before agreement is reached and that is the two sides have to trust each other. Now I think there is very limited trust at the table and uh, I think that there’s responsibility on leading negotiations to see that they build on trust because without trust this will not be resolved and uh, we’ll find ourselves on Monday or Tuesday reacting to events rather than controlling events. And I think we should keep controlling of events. Final point is uh, I think there’s such a divergence in detail. And that as a Eurogroup we can’t be expected to get involved in the negotiating process. In previous occasions if it’s down to two or three net points that are sticking points, the Eurogroup can come up with the appropriate compromises. But when it’s such a wide agenda  how does he see this playing out? Um, um on the limited timeline that is all available to us? So thank you Jeroen, I appreciate how difficult your position is for as far as I’m concerned you’re doing everything possible to resolve the situation.",2015-06-25 00:00:00,Ireland

I’d like to enlist to share Michel’s view that some progress has been made especially if you look backward and let’s not just uh, throw it out the window, that some progress has been made, yet of course the distance is still very large. Um, but at the same time uh, I, I there is flexibility in what the institutions have achieved so far and what they are putting on the table. So one issue is, to me and either made if I understood it correctly alluded  six months of being here looking at a situation which could possibly worse than, be worse than the one we’re facing now. Uh, how we meet in six months times depends essentially on what it Is done that is achieved in the six months. So my final point is uh, let’s not waste opportunity of uh, of having a time in which measures are implemented and in addition to measures some trust building exercise is carried out  Michael point that we need more trust, I couldn’t agree with that and to me trust also, is also built up to implementing as believing that we are all going in the same direction.

christine lagarde,"I would uh, like to uh, to, to address the last point that as made uh, concerning the situation. What has changed? How can we move from where we were six months ago when there was, written of course ,some primary surplus, and where we are today. I think it boils down to two key targets that have been missed for reasons that we can analyze but the first one is primary surplus which has been much lower than what was expected and I think there has been significant slippages in terms of revenue collections in particular over the last, not just the last six months but over the last 12 months, let’s face it. The whole period of the election was also not good from the revenue collections point of view as is often the case in an election period. Since that, it has worsened and uh the primary surplus that was expected out of the operations of uh, the Greek government and the Greek administrations um, has not delivered what was expected. The general climate of uncertainty caused by, where are we, where is it going, what is the situation, what is the position has certainly not helped in that process. I think the second key shortfall which explains also why there has been so much slippage is the privatization. Uh there was a much higher number that was expected out of privatization I think it’s a constant of the Greek programs for the last five years or so but it certainly has not improved. And what we uh, we are perceiving is certainly uh, a concern by the bidders or by those that would be interested potentially in  situation to actually worsen as a result. The point about the uh, the flexibility which uh, many of you have mentioned is, is correct uh. We have actually collected between the three institutions, we have demonstrated a lot of flexibility not just for the targets on which we have agreement with the uh, the Greek authorities, 1, 2, 3.5%  those targets eventually been moved but in terms of the content what will deliver uh , that uh, that, that uh, those consolidation measures and the ultimate result of surplus. We are not, first of all, let’s put it that way we are not in agreement yet. Or maybe we will never be in agreement, I don’t know, I hope it’s a yet rather than never, uh, with the Greek authorities. We, I think, all have a particular concern which we have expressed which is that many of those measures are following suite to the old methods that have been applied by the Greek authorities. Which consist of taxing, taxing and retaxing.",2015-06-25 00:00:00,IMF
speaker 19,"Uh, We certainly would have all preferred that it be less growth and friendly and that there be more in terms of uh, cutting spending than there is on tax revenue generated. Tax as a revenue generating uh, principle. You will see if and when you have time to go though uh, the proposals actually both documents. We think that it’s not particularly growth friendly. Be it as it may it’s even more growth unfriendly in the Greek proposals. Now, why we have not come up with a compare which is you know what uh, lawyers in the room would be used to when you have one document and the other document is because there has been a very um, long standing impossibility for whatever reasons on the part of the Greek party at the table to actually work on the basis of the document. Eventually we came to working on the similar mattress of the document but the last document was put to us at 11:15 earlier today. So as hard as our teams worked and I can assure that they worked the night through. Two nights ago, last night, again, but it was just materially impractically impossible to produce that compare between the two versions. I’ve gone through it myself a little bit, and there are bits and pieces changes pretty much everywhere in the documents. So that’s uh, that’s where we are.",2015-06-25 00:00:00,Unidentified
jeroen dijsselbloem,"Thank you. Yanis, a number of questions were also put to your direction, maybe you could respond.",2015-06-25 00:00:00,EG President
yanis varoufakis,"Yes thank you Jeroen. Let me begin by saying to my Slovenian colleague that uh, and also to others who let it um, sort of created an impression with their intervention that the program was on track until we were elected. Colleagues the reason why we were elected was because the program was off the rails. The only reason. The uh, view that I heard that there was some growth last year is one that I would like very seriously to contest. Nominal GDP never stopped falling. I’ve told you this a number of times. I’m saying this to you again. We never had growth in 2014. Indeed every single target was missed, especially the primary number for 2014. But let’s not look backwards we have a very serious problem here in our hands uh, Christine mentioned that uh, the privatization agenda has not produced the goods, well it didn’t produce the goods in an economy where asset price has collapsed. And therefore it was impossible to reach those completely unfathomable targets. Uh, the point about the primary surpluses, yes there has been flexibility from the institutions but from what level? From four and a half percent primary surplus projections for the next, for the foreseeable future. I do not know an economist who can testify to having a rationale according to which an economy like the Greek economy under the circumstances could maintain, for the medium term, such a large primary surplus. Three and a half percent is still very large but we have accepted it in the spirit of cooperation. Regarding our measures that have been um, repeatedly described as not particularly growth friendly, I have to repeat the point I made before that when you have these large measures, uh, they’re not going to be growth friendly. And I made the point yesterday, I have to make it again, that whether you, it, it’s more growth friendly to reduce very low pensions will have a very high fiscal multiplayer or to increase corporate taxes is an empirical matter. I don’t have the numbers here for, yeah I don’t think that anybody does. Uh, it’s only through trial and error that you will work this one out. Um, the point that uh, Pier Carlo made was very important. Because if he’s right, than I’m very happy. If I correctly understand Pier Carlo, you said that you disagreed with me that if we have an extension for six months or so uh, eight months, nine months, whatever, than without a new um, approach to our debt repayment schedule, without any creative public finance, my prognostication was that in a few months time we will be back to where we are now, because the animal spirits will not come back on, because there will be no growth spurt because there will, because all investors, rational investors will be thinking ahead to the next negotiation. Waiting for what happens at the end of it. Pier Carlo disagreed, he thought that this is not necessarily so. I hope you are right, but I noticed colleagues that at least five of those who spoke, expressed either um, an inability to push through their parliament and through there polity the institutions’ own proposals. Or they said that the, the proposals that are on the table, whether its ours or the institutions’, do not offer a viable solution. Now, this is a very serious political problem, and it speaks to what Michel was saying before. That we have a political duty to come up with an outcome which is sustainable. And I do believe that this is always something that the Eurogroup wants to do and wants to include at the end of every statement, every communique. That the country, the program country that we are discussing is going to, will have insight market access. This was the point we were raising. The reason why we are um, at, at, uh, um, we haven’t agreed yet is because firstly, we ask for more flexibility, not in terms of the fiscal numbers but in terms of measures within those fiscal numbers, and secondly because we can’t see how this very large package can be pushed through all our parliaments. When there is no prospect for more than a few months of an extension. So I come to the conclusion, to the conclusion, to the question that Alexander amongst others asked, so what do we want to do from now on? What do we foresee as the next few steps. Let me, let me, let me say that we are very much like you at a loss. We hope that there are steps we can all take. We are constrained like you by our own parliaments, I cannot go to my parliament and table prior actions like you can’t, like you can’t Wolfgang. We cannot push through our parliaments a set of prior actions without being able to answer the question: is this sustainable? My great concern, as a European, not as a Greek at this very moment, is that, and again I’m alluding to something Alexander said about the kind of governance that we have, that this is a major concern for the way we are running Europe. The way we are running our monetary union. We should not be in position where we throw up our hands up in the air, and we declare that we don’t know how to move ahead. We all have the same interests, we all have a common purpose to bring this to fruition, we should find a way of doing it. I was hoping that today we would be able to come to this agreement. Alexander, I genuinely didn’t want this to go to the Summit tonight or to any other forum. Let us just resolve to make an example out of ourselves so that we can find a way of taking to our parliaments and set of prior actions that will go through the Greek parliament that is sustainable and which you can sell to our own people not just to our members of parliament, honestly and in faith within ourselves that it is truly sustainable.

jeroen dijsselbloem,"Right colleague, thank you all very much for your reactions and your guidance. Think, listen carefully to what you are saying. On the one hand I think the institutions have put forward proposals that they think uh, are final and credible. Which could be the basis for an agreement. A number of you have questions whether these proposals are  tough enough to put it quite bluntly. Uh, uh, that can be debated. On the other hand there are new Greek proposals on some of the prior actions which came in late and therefore I could not hold up sending you the documents. Um, but we recognize some of these proposals that will take us even further from a credible and tough and fiscally sound uh, package. So if you say you must go back and look at these proposals uh, I will ask the institutions if they are prepared to do so. To go through those proposals again. But uh listening to you there is no scope uh, to deviate even more from the MOU, because already you are, some of you are quite critical of the sorry, the aide memoire and papers by the institution because some of you are already quite critical on whether they are good enough. Second point would be that uh, uh, there are also issues of course about debt sustainability, future financing need, the question of a third program. Uh, the way to look at that I think is and has very much to do with trust. To take It step by step, no way can I ask from you or can you ask from parliaments, your parliaments to now agree to future support uh, to Greece. Given the backlash in the program of the last year basically certainly in last half year, the backtracking. So um, I think we should have to take it to rebuild that trust, take it step by step, so we’d be focusing very much on how can we build the package now to come to a successful completion of the current program. Practically speaking that would also mean another extension to get it done to disperse etcetera. The extension can only be limited given the amount of money still available to the current program. On that basis and if that approach is successful, is successful in the coming months, because the program gets back on track and in the end will lead to a positive uh final review, we could in the fall return to the question, how do we move forward? Uh, and I would not like to exclude that if the program is back on track and Greece  that is the thing, the way I think we could approach this issue. But of course we can only come to that debate if there is an agreement on how to finalize this problem, we’ve always said this, first we need an agreement on what needs to be done and it needs to be implemented successful final review and then we are in a new phase in which hopefully trust has also returned a little and we can talk about the future. Debt sustainability further financial support where needed etcetera, it Is to early now. So that will be my sequencing. Anyway returning to where we are now, we need an agreement and many of you are still underlined stressed the importance of an agreement, we need an agreement on how to fix the current program, in a credible way. Um, so what I think we should do is ask the institutions if they are prepared to work with the Greeks on new proposals, but they would have to stay in current lines, and not deviate further. I think this is .",2015-06-25 00:00:00,EG President

Are we going to further gained make progress, that what I’m just curious about?

So how are we going to make progress is what I want to know? I think the question is really to our Greek collogues. Where do you move, towards what has been put together?

yanis varoufakis,"We’re all in this room hoping for an agreement as I said, but we all have constraints in terms of our mandates. All colleagues do. We do not have a mandate, to um, accept the backtracking that we not is from the institutions. For instance, for days now the institutions have been um, pressurizing us to accept that, this is just an example, that catering In restaurants should go up from 13% to 23% of a um, V-A-T range, and when we, in ,in, in the spirit of cooperation, we said yes last night uh, we were told that this would not yield the improvement in revenues that the, the model we had commonly worked on and we’d agreed would be the common basis, delivered.

There is a demand by the institutions that we take hotels to 23% of V-A-T, when on the opposite coast, a mile, a nautical mile away in Turkey it’s seven percent. Now I do not have the mandate to simply say that for the purposes of a-a-achieving an agreement now I will sign up to this dotted line. This is another example of inflexibility. There is a great deal of this. This is how the Greek side sees it and I think that you should know it. Maybe we are wrong, maybe the institutions are right, or vice-versa. On the question of what, how do we take It from here just like Pier, just like Christine, just like Mario, of course we are willing and ready to continue work but when Jeroen you say that we have to work within the lines I, I need to ask you to tell me exactly what this means. That this means either we accept the document of the institutions or else? Is it what one of the colleagues said that it’s a take it or leave it.

Nonetheless, the Commission, the ECB have said, and, and Christine in principle, have said of course willing to agree, uh, Christine has raised the question, how are we going to get there if you just keep putting in new proposals that’s take away fiscal space that’s uh, take away the urgency from structural reforms, that uh, shift balance even more towards taxes and less to revenue cuts.

alexander stubb,"Thank you very much Jeroen. I was listening to what Wolgfang and Luis and then Luis was confused me to but l-let me try to, I mean as a rookie um, I’m trying to simplify grossly the way which I see it. Um, there is a group of Euro countries that have a clear parliamentary mandate which is based on the uh, MOU. Then, there is one euro country which sort of had a mandate for that but not really. Then the institutions where asked to negotiate with Greece a new document uh, which is called aide memoire, which doesn’t really exist because it hasn’t been proposed. And now we have a discussion on aide memoire and a possible Greek proposal. Now, there was talk about this being a take it or leave it agreement. And I would have a tendency to agree with that. There’s been strong talk about trust and how to take this forward. And may I, Yanis, put forward a proposal. For Wolfgang, I am taking an extreme. The aide memoire and the document of the institutions go too far. For you it doesn’t go far enough. The IMF and others have asked you to make sure that you can push it through. My suggestion would be that you take the aide memoire and a strong set of prior actions to your parliament this weekend. If it passes we will continue to negotiate, if it doesn’t pass that’s the end of the road. Because we have a mandate for the memorandum of understanding but we need to be sure that you’ll be able to push it through a aide- memoire. And right now I sense in Eurogroup that this is simply ain’t gonna happen. So we need to be sure because otherwise it’s going to be impossible for us to take aide memoire in to the parliaments. So, I would fall into the category of saying, at least from my perspective, we are pretty much in a take it or leave it situation, but you need to tee it up with your parliament first. Sorry for that this is perhaps rookie bluntness, but that’s how I see it.",2015-06-25 00:00:00,Finland
jeroen dijsselbloem,"Let me make a couple of points on the process also in a response to Luis’s remarks. Starting point for us was you read it in 20th_february statements, the old program, the old MOU. But we allowed uh, on two grounds, some flexibility for the institutions to work out a new agreement. Once again for which the old MOU is a basis. The first kind of flexibility was that the institutions, take with a Commission have taken to account the new  and then we can continue to negotiate. Uh, I think that will work. Uh, so there needs to be a an agreement uh, and if he wants uh, a take it or leave it approach that is also possible, you can simply say yes. That is also an option, seriously because we are coming to the end of our time, our creativity, our options. Uh, but if you have uh, last proposals that are feasible that will strengthen the credibility I have not seen them but strengthen the credibility, then there is little time left and that’s why in ask the institutions if they will still be prepared to look at that. Um, I’m going to adjourn for lets say ten minutes to talk to the institutions uh, on what options we see eh, to move forward in this process. Just ten minutes.",2015-06-25 00:00:00,EG President

After having put those on the table, they were last proposals from the Greek side, and we asked the institutions to look at those. Uh, we’ve now reconvened to hear basically the position of the Greek, uh, government to see where we are. And Eurogroup in our last meeting, of course, did not take a formal position, there was no agreement between the institutions and Greek authorities at the time, so if we can spare to give the floor to Yanis first, to tell us about the position the Greek government, apparently, already has taken. To be informed about that, and then we’ll take it from there to see what our position should be. Yanis, can I give the floor to your first.",2015-06-27 00:00:00,EG President
yanis varoufakis,"Thank you, Jeroen. Thank you, colleagues. In our last meeting we were presented with quite a comprehensive set of documents from the institutions containing proposed Prior Actions. Uh, debt sustainability analysis that was endorsed by the Commission, but not by the… not fully, at least, by the International Monetary Fund, as well as, uh, a proposal regarding funding for the proposed period of the five month extension. Now, the Prior Actions that were presented, um, contain many parts that we consider very difficult to convince our parliament about. And therefore, they make it extremely onerous for us to pass through Parliament this particular set of Prior Actions. Now, even setting, however, that aside, uh, what makes in our estimation impossible to pass through Parliament this comprehensive proposal by the institutions, is the lack of an answer to an important question. Will these painful measures at least give us a period of tranquility, during which to carry out the reforms that we need to carry out? Will a shock of optimism, c- counter the recessionary effect of the extra fiscal consolidation that is being expected of a country that has been in a recession for 21 consecutive, consecutive quarters? And the answer to us, the honest answer is no. The institutions’ proposal is offering us no such prospect. As for the funding that is being put to us for the next five months, we consider it to be problematic in a variety of ways. Firstly, it makes no provision for the states arrears caused by five months of making payments without disbursements. And of the falling tax revenues that are, uh, res- a re- a result of this prolonged negotiation, and the constant threat of Grexit, which is wafting in the air. Secondly, the idea of dipping into the funds of the HFSF, I called it cannibalizing the HFSF, in order to repay the ECB’s SMP bonds, bonds in July and August constitutes a clear and present danger. Greece’s fragile banks, possibly through, um, an operation that deals with a m- mountainous NPL’s that eant- eat into, uh, their capitalization, uh, could be stabilized. However, by using up this fund for the purposes of repaying the SMP bonds held by the ECB, we’re doing away with a very important resource that the second program, the current program has designated to this task of dealing with the problem of the banks. When I asked, uh, an official of the ECB, so what we do once we use up an important part of this capital of the HFSF, how do we deal with bank and capitalizations, which is what the HFSF was there for? The answer I received was “Well, it will be replenished.” “How?” I asked. The answer was, “Through the ESM.” But this is, a leap into the unknown because it is not part of the proposed deal that there is some kind of automated or quasi-automated replenishment of the HFS- HFSF, from the ESM, and as I’m sure Wolfgang will tell us all, that would require a new program. So, a new program is embedded into this few month-long extension, even though it is not articulated as such. And that is, um, a very serious problem. I think that many of you would have problems pushing this through your parliaments, and I cannot take a proposal, a funding proposal to my parliament which includes a provision that you couldn’t put through your parliaments. Um, thirdly, the proposed disbursements schedule as presented to us by the institutions is a minefield of reviews. There is, I understand the problem of trust, but if you look at it technically, it means that we will have one review per month. Our government, instead of concentrating on passing the important reforms that we need to reform… to- to- to- to pass, we are going to be constantly engaged, week in, week out from tomorrow in this reviewing process, which will lead to what? It will lead to another negotiation like the one we had over the last five months, with the institutions, with the Eurogroup, consecutive Eurogroup meetings sometime in October, November, in order to determine the parameters of a new program, and I don’t think that none of us can actually take this process, um, as it is implied by this proposi- proposal of the institutions that was tabled here two days ago. Fourthly, given the that it is abundantly clear that our debt will remain unsustainable by the end of this year, and that market access will remain as distant as it has been of recent, it is our assessment that the International Monetary Fund cannot be counted upon to disperse each share 3.5 billion, the share that the institutions are counting as part of the funding package on the table. And that is another problem. If I’m asked in parliament, my parliament what are the chances that this part of the funding package is going to be dispersed, in all honesty, I’ll have to say to them, minuscule. These are solid reasons why our government does not consider it has a mandate to accept the institutions’ proposal. And moreover, let’s be honest here, even if we were just for the benefit of ending this process and signing and sealing an agreement, we could not pass it through our parliament. And the result of that would be much worse than what we are doing now, the situation we found ourselves in now. It would mean that our government would fall, we would lose our, uh, support in parliament, and we would go into a process, an electoral process that would last a minimum of 23 days. Now, at the very same time, colleagues, our government does not have a mandate, and I want to insist on that, I want to, to, to ask for your, uh, attention here, we do not have a mandate to turn down the institutions’, uh, pro- proposals, out of hand. Our party received 36% of, in the 25th of January election, together the two governing parties have just over 40% of the vote. Fully cognizant of how weighty the present moment in history is, we feel obliged to put the institutions’ proposal to the people of Greece. We shall endeavor to spell out to them fully, what a yes to the institutions’ proposal means, to do the same regarding a no vote. We have our own recommendation but it is not binding on the Greek people, it is they who are sovereign, uh, decision makers. And we are going to accept their verdict fully and we, we’ll do whatever it takes to implement it, one way or another. We believe that calling a referendum is optimal given the constraints that we face because as I said, firstly, it’s the only alternative we have to, to a, uh, a collapse of the government, a failure to push through parliament the proposal of the institutions. But let me add another wrinkle to this, even if we managed somehow to pass it through our parliament, we would be facing a major problem of ownership of the program and implementation. Put simply, just as in the past, Greek governments pushed through policies dictated by the institutions, but could not carry the people with them, we too would fail in doing so. So, let me now concentrate on the question we are going to be putting to the, to the Greek people. Much has been discussed as to what it will be. We are very clear on this, there is a proposal by the institutions, maybe it will change today, maybe it won’t. This is what we’re putting to the Greek people, we’re asking them to instruct us, to accept it fully without further negotiations, which we shall do if the Greek people tell us to do this, or to negotiate further, if there is room for further negotiations. Many journalists… I’ll wait and see if there is such a view here, comment and there is a logic to it, that this could be a referendum on the Euro, well, on Greece’s participation in the Euro. Let me be very clear on this, colleagues, our participation in Euro, in the Euro is not, and cannot be part of any referendum. Let me remind you that the European Union treaties have no… make no provisions for an exit from the Euro, and it would be a violation of the EU treaties, for us to go anywhere near that question. The question is very simple, there is a proposal by the institutions. The institutions worked very hard to come up with it. We could not bring ourselves to signing it for reasons I have explained, it is up to the Greek people to decide. The suggestion that we’re coming to you with is that a one-month extension is offered of the existing arrangement so as to allow a smooth transition from today to the 6th of July so as to allow the Greek people, in calmness to deliberate, to consider the proposal which is in front of them, and to make a considered judgment on that basis. I would like to ask the secretariat to distribute a letter to the president of the Eurogroup, um, maybe it has already been dis- distributed, by which we are making this, um, suggestion/request formal. Our task today is to circumnavigate a number of uh, troubles, and to find the safest route towards an outcome that allows the Greek people to come to pass judgment on what is a comprehensive proposal by the institutions. These are critical moments and the decisions we make are momentous. In years to come, I think that this meeting is going to feature prominently in the way that we answer to history’s demands over us. Thank you.",2015-06-27 00:00:00,Greece
jeroen dijsselbloem,"Thank you, Yanis. Um, can I say that, um, I am sorry that we, we have come to, to this negative conclusion.  prepared to come to an agreement with the institutions on the basis of the proposals that the institutions have jointly put on the table.",2015-06-27 00:00:00,EG President
yanis varoufakis,Yeah.,2015-06-27 00:00:00,Greece
jeroen dijsselbloem,"But I think that’s a political fact that we have to accept at this point before us now, what consequences we think that it should have. There’s also a separate request from your side, uh, of the table. The reality of the situation given that negative decision, will be  before the expiration of the program Tuesday at midnight as that is the situation where we are, responsibility of that aligns with the Greek government and the fact that they have taken this decision to enter the talks with this conclusion. I will give the floor to ministers because I think this is very much a political, uh, decision. Uh, the institutions have done their work and put joint papers on the table in our last meeting. So, I will, uh, give the floor to ministers to start with.",2015-06-27 00:00:00,EG President
michael noonan,"Thanks very much, Jeroen. It’s, uh, it’s disappointing to come and be in the position we’re in now. Uh, this is the fifth time in 10 days we have come together and when we finished on Thursday evening, we had an institutional paper on the table, and we had a counter paper from the Greek authorities. And while there was, uh, quite a divergence between the two positions there was always also a lot of similarities. And I thought that if we met today, uh, that’s why the gap wouldn’t be closed completely, that the gap would be narrowed somewhat, and that there would be a single paper, that, uh, the Greek authorities could put to their parliament. But, uh, the prospective last round of negotiations that I anticipated is not now available because last night, the Greek authorities decided to end the negotiations, uh, by announcing a referendum, and by saying that they would, uh, recommend to, to the Greek people to turn down, uh, the paper of the institutions, uh, even though it’s full format was not yet decided, and was pending the result of today’s meeting. So, that leaves us in, in a very bad position because effectively one side has, has gone from the negotiations. And, uh, it’s a matter for, for the Greek authorities, but, uh, there was no indication of that when the heads of state and government meeting ended on Friday evening. My prime minister said he went, he went back to Dublin on the understanding that there would be a further round of talks today, which would have meant to a further bridging of the gap. So, it leaves us all in, in a very difficult situation, and it also- also has brought about, uh, a situation in my view where, uh, the Greek authorities, uh, and to a certain degree, all of us in politics across the EU, uh, are losing control of the situation. I think it’s moving now to a position where the markets and public opinion, particularly in Greece, uh, is going to be the deciding factor. And, uh, we’re looking here, at, at the iPad and, uh, there are queues at ATM machines in Greece, uh, at the minute in Athens. Uh, there are queues for petrol and diesel in Athens. And, uh, that seems to me that we now are in a situation where the crisis has commenced whereas the conversation this morning was, what will we do on Monday if there were a crisis? I don’t think it’s Monday anymore, it’s now. And on the data coming in, 250 million went out of the Greek ATM machines last night against a normal weekend withdrawal purview. So the signs are very clear, and, uh, it’s very hard to stop trends like that once they commence because they are not subject to any reaction or inaction. Uh, public opinion and the market perception takes over. And I think we’re in a, in a very dangerous situation, and, uh, I’m very sorry it has come to this. Uh, I think, Yanis, the, the decision of your cabinet last night was technically mistaken. Uh, I think if you could reverse it, you might retrieve some of the situation uh, but we’re, we’re, we’re in a very bad situation now where no matter what the political decisions are, I think it’s going to be, uh, a very, a very bad and a very unpredictable outcome.

wolfgang schäuble,"Thank you, Jeroen. I would like here to echo on what, uh, Tony said. Of course, it is certain of a wider Greek authorities to arrange them to, uh, uh, uh a referendum. It’s hard to Greek authorities whether it’s government, whether it’s parliament, there’s the matter of the Greek constitution  Greece. But, uh, the, the, um, the program for Greece, the so-called MOU, is, uh, something different. The institutions had been . Therefore, the, thought, thought is that what we have .

But if I want to make a, a quick decision on a- on a- on a position which is binding, we need an arrangement, an agreement, what is the substance of the decision?

What is he proposing, um, that the government stand would be on this referendum? Is he not telling the people to vote for the package,  is going to against it, what does that imply? Um, what is he going to explain to the Greek people that if they were to vote, as he is suggesting to them to vote against, what would that lead to?

yanis varoufakis,"Happy to do so, Jeroen, thank you. I am going to tell the Greek people, we are going to tell the Greek people what we told you here. That the proposal which is on the table, or was on the table, last in, in the last Eurogroup meeting, in our, considered opinion and after having studied it very carefully, is financially not sustainable. And that we consider it to be a proposal which we could not accept even though we were fully determined to go well beyond our electoral platform, we already have… Michael is correct, uh, Michael Noonan, um, mentioned that the, um, Prior Actions that we have proposed are very, very close to the ones that the institutions have proposed. That shows to what extent we were prepared to travel across a very large landscape to meet the institutions’ view. But the whole package, if you look at the funding, if you look at the debt situation, debt sustainability, is simply not one that I can recommend to the Greek people as a package that is tough medicine. I do not mind tough medicine, but this is toxic. It is not a package that would actually work and prevent you from having to come back to this Eurogroup meeting in two months time to have another such tedious round, discussing the lack of sustainability of the Greek situation.",2015-06-27 00:00:00,Greece

So, this is my answer to Wolfgang, you’re quite right, Wolfgang, we’re not deliberating with the Eurogroup, we’re deliberating with the Greek people. We’re seeking from them a clear instruction to sign the MOU, as it was presented to us, as amended by the institutions. If the Greek people say no to this then we’re going to have to deliberate amongst ourselves and with you, in order to find out what the optimal arrangement is for every one in Europe.",2015-06-27 00:00:00,Greece

yanis varoufakis,"Thank you, Jeroen. Well, the answer to, let me be, go straight to the answer that I’m, I want to give to Michel Sapin. The answer is, of course, yes. There’s always room for negotiation. There’s always room for deliberation. Colleagues, the process is simple. The institutions and the members of state negotiate. The institutions have the final word on the draft agreement that is put to the Eurogroup. If the members states and the ministers agree, okay. The great unanswered question is what happens if there is no agreement either because the government of the members states says no or because it differs to the electorate through a referendum as we have done? Then we enter uncharted territory, which we must chart together. But again, Michel, we are here, we are open to having discussions and rest assured that if that global package is in equilibrium, to use an expression that you used earlier, uh, we will reconsider. But the question we have to answer to our own parliament and to our own people is, is this package that we agreed to? Does it contain a significant probability that we will be able to recover in the next few months and set off on the road to recovery? If the answer is that we are agreeing to, um, a hurdle or a series of hurdles that come together, come attached with very stringent measures that enhance the recessionary elements without offering any chance of achieving escape velocity towards the end of this extension, then our recommendation will have to remain to the Greek people that this is not a sustainable offer.",2015-06-27 00:00:00,Greece

pier carlo padoan,"Thank you Jeroen. I guess, you all feel how difficult this moment is, and in moments like this one who likes to see most of clarity so that one can work out the implications and decisions, which I fully respect on any side. However, as I continue to listen to this discussion, to this ongoing debate between, uh, Yanis and, and colleagues, uh, I get more and more confused. Um, I’m more and more confused about what is the strategy of the Greek authorities. Uh, we are presented with the fact that this of course is absolutely in the right of the Greek people and government that there is a referendum to vote yes or no to a proposal, which proposal? Uh, may I ask, uh, politely whether you’re going to describe measure by measure, uh, alternatives by alternatives to the Greek people what, uh, views are and what if, for instance, in the mind of the electorate there is agreement in one measure and disagreement on the other measure? Uh, I’m even more puzzled by the fact that as so stated the government is going to support a no rather than a yes. Then as  was asking, what if the result is yes? Is that a no confidence vote in the government? You also said, Yanis, that you might want to ask Greek people to have a mandate on a long-term program. Is this a different referendum or is it going to be in the set of questions? And then if you, uh, ask for a mandate for a long-term program, are you going to also explain that in order to get the long-term program, which since the beginning I personally supported, there are some steps which are necessary given that there is a current program. And finally, uh, are you going to discuss the consequences of whatever outcome the referendum is to Greece or the Greek people? And in general, uh, are, are you going to go beyond this specific point or are you going just to say that with the referendum, that’s the end of it?

yanis varoufakis,"Pier Carlo, your questions are, are spot on and I welcome them because clarity is necessary. Let me be very clear, if the answer on Sunday, the 6th, by the Greek people is that we should sign, we will sign, and we will sign immediately. You’ve asked, Pier Carlo, very pertinent political question. Does this mean that it will not, uh, will this not be a vote of lack of confidence, uh, withdrawal of confidence from the government? Maybe it will be, maybe we’ll need to have a different governmental configuration that will pass the agreement as offered by the institutions through parliament. We will do whatever it takes… to quote Mario, politically in order to remain faithful to the verdict of the Greek people if the Greek people say yes or no. You asked a question, which I think is very important these days. You said, “Will you describe to the Greek people the SLAs, the Prior Actions that were proposed by the institutions and compare them and contrast them with the ones that you propose as a Greek government measure by measure by measure?” Yes we will, we have, we are very strong believers in the capacity of people, or voters to be active citizens and to make, uh, considered analysis and take, uh, decisions responsibly concerning the future of their country, this is what democracy is all about. Uh, you asked the question about the long-term. Our objective, as you know, we have discussed with the two of us, was always to come to an agreement that might be tough, that might be, uh, bitter medicine, but which would come part and parcel of a broader package that would take Grexit of the table. The greatest problem that the Greek economy now has is the fear of Grexit. This negative expectation which impedes investment, it impedes consumption, it impedes growth. This package as presented by institutions does not contain any hope of this in the near future. Instead, what it promises is an ext- extension of the current uncertainty through one review after the other, leading to another negotiation like this. I think that it, I, I’m, I’m puzzled for once by the lack of comprehension of how important that is and our collective failure to come up with a package that doesn’t extend the crisis, pretending that it has solved it for a few months. Um, you asked me whether we are going to discuss the consequences of a no vote. Yes we will, to the extent that it is possible to discuss consequences concerning an uncharted territory. But let me finish by asking, posing my own question. Yes, this uncharted territory is very frightening for us. It’s devastating. It scares us. I’m sure it scares everyone. However, does this mean that because a no vote or a n- negative decision by a government like ours is scary? Does this mean that a government li- our, like ours should accept any package proposed to it? I submit to you that if we’ve reached that point in Europe, then we should reconsider what we have done.",2015-06-27 00:00:00,Greece

You know, regardless of, uh, you know, uh, if this is a proposal that is not the proposal of the Eurogroup, is the proposal of the institutions, but we are having a referendum about a proposal. This is something that has been, you know, put forward by other colleagues, and I am not going to elaborate any- anymore. Thirdly, and this is also important. You are, you know, s- uh, supporting, the no, so you, you, you call a referendum with eight days in advance about a proposal that, uh, you say, “No, no, no, we are not going…” you are against that proposal that I don’t know really, you know, uh, uh, whose proposal has been, uh, you know, uh, look who, who’s are the authors of this, this proposal?

Uh, you know, today and, you know, uh, we, we, we, we, you know, you, you knew it perfectly that, uh, we had to, you know, you’re gonna look today that, uh, us, Michael has said, you know, the gap, uh, between your proposal and ours was, or the proposal of the institutions, was not the, you know, as big, that, you know, could, we can, we could bridge, you know, this gap, you know, during this meeting and we got presented us, a sort of fait accompli, and this fait accompli, you know, makes our life extremely, extremely, extremely difficult, you know, this is a breaker in a sense of the negotiations, you know, that’s the impression that I have. Uh, simultaneously, you’re requesting an extension. You know, I have read the letter that you have, that you have forwarded to, to Jeroen and you’re requesting, you know, an extension of the program. But, uh, Yanis, I think that the, we have, we have commented and we have elaborated a lot about trust during our lesen- recent meetings. Do you think really that, you know, with the, you know, calling this referendum with these characteristics, you know, is a trust-building event?

alexander stubb,"Thanks, uh, Jeroen. I, I, I’d like to make two comments, and then perhaps a few questions to, to Yanis. I, I think, I think I agree with all colleagues that either last night or this morning  on the table. And I, uh, I think that’s a situation in which we are now, we’ve basically come to a dead end. There’s no p- in this game of cat and mouse, but, but, you know, we’ve come to basically a dead end. And, and this brings me to my, my second point. I, I agree, we should spend our time here talking about the next steps, uh, of, uh, plan B. There’s absolutely no possibility we’ll get any kind of an outcome from here. I, I agree with Pier Carlo, we need clarity and that clarity is, is the next steps. Uh, to be quite honest, the way in which I see things unravelling is that number one, the program will not be extended. Number two, Greece will be unable to pay the IMF. Number three, uh, there will be a run on the banks, which has obviously already started. Number four, if there is no EL- uh, extension of the program, they will be no ELA. Number five, they will be both political and economic chaos. Number six, you will not be able to pay salaries and you will not be able to pay pensions. Number seven, you will probably be pretty much, uh, on your own. Um, number eight, there’ll be capital restrictions. Number nine, the IMF will not pay and number of 10, the EU will not pay. Against this background, which I find a horrifying perspective, especially from a Greek perspective, I think we should focus our time on how to protect the eurozone and how to stay unified. And my simple question will be rather blunt, Yanis, is that have you seriously been able to explain the consequences of the actions that you’re currently taking and then the risks that you are taking to the Greek people? Now, my question is also of trust. I left this meeting on the first day, can’t say I was happy about it, but I left in good faith thinking that negotiations between the institutions in Greece will take place, but obviously they haven’t. And then we’re surprised with announcement of a referendum. And how can we trust your actions if your prime minister comes out, and these are quotes, quotes on the  memoir, “Contravenes the founding principles and values of Europe.” In which way? “Accumulates unbearable new burdens”. Yeah. To all of us.”Amplifies social imbalances”. “Violates fundamental rights to work, equality and to dignity.” “Blackmail ultimatum.” And, “Strict and humiliating austerity.” Now, if I was a Greek voter, no matter how pro-European I was, and if I was listening to my prime minister saying that I would personally be voting against that package. So what is there really at the end of the day anymore to negotiate? I really think that this is a sad day for all of us and I think it’s time to start talking the next steps. Sorry for being so blunt, but that’s just how I see things right now.",2015-06-27 00:00:00,Finland

maria luís albuquerque,"Thank you, Jeroen. As much has, has been said, I’ll just like to add that, that I do know by experience how difficult it is to implement the program, how difficult it is to announce difficult measures, um, and I know that it’s, it’s hard because even if you believe, if you defend what needs to be done, and if you believes that it is the best for your country. And one of the reasons why I think that our program and others have succeeded is because of ownership, which you also mentioned that it is very important, because we did believe that would be, uh, the best way to implement these tough measures because the outcome would, would be worth it. So, and, and this demands mutual trust between ourselves and the institutions and real belief that this is the right way. So I see absolutely no way, as Jeroen just mentioned, how can the government defend a no, use the terms you accused to clarif- to, to discuss or to classify the proposals under the  and then implement them because they are to, to failure. It’s impossible that they would work and one would never know if they had a problem of design or a problem implementation. It wouldn’t be possible to tell them apart, but it is a certainty that they would fail. With this kind of attitude from the beginning, they could never provide the results which would be needed. So, obviously, I, like, uh, everyone else, I’m sure, fully respe- respect your decision to make a referendum and ask your people whatever you think should be asked. But please bear in mind that whatever comes out of the decision of the one, of one country cannot presume decisions from all the other 18.

rimantas šadžius,"Thank you, Jeroen. Uh, from the very beginning, uh, this negotiation with the new Greek authorities, uh, seemed very strange to me. Well, I understood from the very, uh, onset, from, from February that the new Greek government, uh, was trapped between economic realities that I think we do understand very well around this table and, uh, pre-election promises. Uh, and this is a difficult situation to any new government. Of course, uh, the political elite of the country should, uh, work upon overcoming this post-election syndromes. And I think in many countries, uh, uh, pre-election, um, pre-election promises and the, the, uh, real action, um, uh, differ more or less, uh, in different countries. Uh, it depends on the, on the style of this election campaign, but, uh, nevertheless, uh, please recall that at the very first meeting, um, Pierre Moscovici told that there are three trajectories and we were discussing about, uh, the first two, and it was me who said, well, I think the most realistic was the third trajectory that we do nothing and everything goes on, uh, as it should go. Um, the, on, uh, based on economic grounds. My thoughts, my, my hope was, uh, that, uh, sometime later, uh, the Greek gov- new Greek government will feel the economic reality that it encounters in the country and, uh, things will start normalize. But all these, uh, six months, that’s, uh, the, the previous, uh, program was extended, was spent mostly… please, uh, please, let’s be frank to us, ourselves, was spent by waiting proposals from the Greek side. And these proposals, the first proposals that came where, some of them were, were, were quite naive like, uh, video cameras on housewives, uh, and, and students, things like that. Uh, but, uh, unfortunately during all these six months, uh, nothing has changed in the real economic policy of, of, of the, the Greek government and Greek state. Now, the situation, economic situation is very difficult, very difficult. So, uh, this third trajectory didn’t work for, for some reason. I don’t know… I can’t suppose why. And the argument, for me, to, to make, um, um, the, uh, this position is, uh, the proposal for referendum. Look, uh, the government proposes to have a referendum where they propose for the people to answer no. That means that government has no constructive position, that the government by itself is destructive. It’s no way, uh, to, to, to carry on the issues there, uh, this way. And of course, if the government is by itself, the present government is by itself so destructive, automatically it follows that whatever kind of the negotiations we have here, there is no agreement possible. If there is no constructive position that could be, well, uh, posed to, to Greek people to answer yes, it’s nothing to talk about. Now, uh, the third and the very important issue in all this process is, uh, not money but moral, political and moral hazard. Um, yes, during the negotiations with institutions, with Eurogroup, with leaders and now with Greek people that you are going to discuss, uh, these, uh, all these, uh, matters about  the tax perhaps, uh, you became, uh, the front-page story, that, no doubt about that. Uh, the worst thing is that many countries and in Lithuania for, for sure, you became also the last page story, a kind of bande designé, a cartoon. And this means that it will be extremely difficult to talk about helping this country afterwards when we talk about subsequent programs. Uh,  reason to extend, uh, the, the present program again for one month. The previous that was signed only by minister of finance, which doesn’t mean the decision of the government, uh, at least enumerated reasons for what reason the, uh, program should be extended. Now, we haven’t given that, so I think we should stick to the principles. I agree very much with those, uh, who said that, uh, uh, no extension, um, uh, of the present program is possible because there is no substance of such kind of extension.

I think, uh, uh speaking on behalf of the country, that is a firm believer in the Euro and the virtue, uh, of what we have built together, uh, around that common currency, today’s very sad day. Um, it’s a very sad day because we had all tried, uh, from the beginning of the year to find solutions and today it seems that there’s very little hope left. I must concur with those who have mentioned their prime minister who was really shocked to hear the news that the referendum would be held, as there was the summit a couple of hours ago. But this was not mentioned, at least to our knowledge, it was not mentioned. And I speaking with many colleagues, it seems that no one was informed. Obviously, this is the contrary of building confidence. Now, nobody’s disputing or questioning the right of Greece hold a referendum on such an important subject. But what is really troublesome is the timing of this announcement because if that is, um, what’s the intention of the Greek government, this decision could have been taken months ago or at least weeks ago. So today, this late referendum interferes with the whole timetable that we have agreed together. Now, we’re asked to postpone the deadlines, but may I remember with you all together, we have already postponed by four months on the 20th_february the deadlines.  ample time to work and share different proposals which were not used efficiently. I’d also like to say that what is at stake is, uh, the credibility, uh, of the eurozone itself. We’ve been negotiating here four months and, uh, if it is the right of the Greek government to ask its population, what it thinks, uh, of an eventual deal, which is not on the table by the way. So we’re really wondering what is going to be asked and, to the Greek population. I completely agree with the questions mentioned by Michel Sapin. We also have public opinions and we have to explain to them what’s going on. So in this context, I really don’t see a perspective of how we can continue to negotiate. Where is there still space to find a common solution? Where is the space to still stay in the same common framework?

Almost 15% of local deposits inside which are been carried with subsidiaries of Greek banks. And we know that Greek banks have, are already under severe pressure. Let me clearly state that we should not be taking any chances, nor should we rely on the expectation that there will be no contagion or that depositors will behave calmly and rationally. Mutually beneficial options are available as we speak, and there’s at the least one perspective private sector buyer for these subsidiaries.

mario draghi,"Thank you, Jeroen. Let me just go through some possible implications of the new developments. I have to say it’s possible because, uh, the, it would be the Governing Council, of course, to take, uh, the decisions that, uh, . Uh, first of all, uh, the, um, continued, uh, non-objection to increasing the ELA was based, uh, on rules that say that ELA would be continued to be given by the Bank of Greece to banks that have, uh, a colla- adequate collateral and are solvent. Now, the recent developments are actually questioning, putting into question, uh, both the, both these, both these features. Uh, the , say withdrawal or deposits, uh, fro- from the banks. So we are in a full, full-fledged basically crisis and therefore the collateral will soon not be available, won’t be adequate. But there’s also another, uh, aspect whereby collateral may not be adequate and that has to do with the, the developments in the financial markets, decreasing interest rates, which basically decrease the value of the collateral. There’s also another aspect, however, it has to do with solvency of the banks. Uh, pretty soon, uh, the SSM, ECB as SSM will have to undertake an assessment, a solvency assessment of the Greek banking system and clearly, clearly, uh, the, uh, the government bond or the government, uh, issued assets, uh, will have to be subject to  and this will, uh, will increase the evidently the, uh, s-, the fragility of the banking system, also putting into question the solvency. And this is all only for the government paper. The government paper is of two kinds, the government bonds and the rest which is DTA and DTCs, namely deferred tax assets, deferred tax credits. This adds up on to the already difficult situation of the non-performing loans towards the private sector. So, uh, all these, uh, developments that have been outlined, uh, put into question the two basic pillars upon which ELA has been, uh, has been granted so far. What to do about banks. Of course, uh, the, uh, Bank of Greece is the resolution authority at this point in time so we’ll consider and with the, with the help of course the of the, of the, of the Commission and the ECB whether to adopt a moratorium or a resolution with Greek banks or a bank holiday. We won’t be specific on all this point, uh, at this pointl in time. Uh, incidentally, I just answered your point, Yanis, about  or for anything else. Um, one last point about what, uh, we do, uh, what the ECB will do, uh, as far as the, uh, the  necessary. One word as, uh, as a conclusion. This, I mean we discussed, we went through this scenario of a gradually weakening banking system at the very beginning of our discussions here. I remember in this Eurogroup. Now, these scenarios now unfolded. It, it’s, uh, it’s unfolded and the main consequence since four or five months ago is that the recession simply got worse and worse. And the reasons why for this recession are two: uncertainty and lack of credit. And the recent developments have only increased both, uncertainty, uh, and will further worsen the line of credit.

christine lagarde,"Tha- thank you very much. I would, uh, I have to say that from, uh, a personal perspective as well as from an IMF perspective, I was also shocked, uh, when I found out at the very early hours of the morning that negotiations had stopped, uh, with the team and that referendum was announced by the prime minister of Greece. I was certainly not involved in the consultation process that may have taken place in that respect and it came as a, as, as a massive, uh, surprise and a very sad development of this. Um, clearly many of you have expressed, um, the frustration, the sadness, which I, I, I share as well. And, you know, acknowledging that this is a complete, uh, breaking point where what has just been described by Alessandro and supplemented by Mario is likely to unravel in the next hours. I have to add that the, uh, probable, uh, consequence of that, although, I haven’t heard anything to the, to the contrary, might be the international community at large in the fall of the IMF, which is, uh, possibly not going to receive the, uh, bundled payments that failed during the course of June and which are due for payment on Tuesday, uh, close of business and for which, uh, I believe that a little bit of preparatory work needs to take place. Uh, I would like to, uh, receive some, uh, assurance or one way or the other. And I also understand that the proposal to use the ESM as we as a, as a proxy, uh, for Greece was at some stage proposed and we’d be interested to explore that alternative on behalf of the international community, which is also at the table. I would just like to submit one thing, um, I just cannot understand why, why Greece says that there has been a total lack of confidence on the part of the creditors at large, including all the Euro area member states as indicated by the . And at the same time when the negotiators recognized that between the three institutions’ joint proposal and the Greece late, and Greece later proposals, there is hardly any difference. And we’re so close, which I have slight doubt about. But if it is true that the Greek position is very, very close to the three institutions, then to actually bridge that gap of lack of trust, it’s really on Greece to make the gesture of moving in that direction and actually to decide not to go in that direction, not to go and clench a conclusion. That would mean accepting the proposal by the three institutions, assuming it would be endorsed by the Eurogroup numbers, of course, I don’t understand why this is not happening, and it falls on the Greek party to actually do that. Now, I understand equally that . It also rely heavily on assurance that subject implementation, the creditors, European partners will be there to support financially, to organize the debt operation if necessary, as provided under the DSA in order to give some financial future. But things clearly need to come in that sequential order, given the breach of trust that has taken place. So that’s really what I would like to say. Why do you you not, why do you not take that step, given the shortage of trust and the closeness that ? Thank you.",2015-06-27 00:00:00,IMF

yanis varoufakis,"Thank you, Jeroen. I shall begin with a question that, uh, and the comment that my good friend on my right here, Luis, made. Um, Luis, today in the Eurogroup, we are making very important decisions, but nevertheless, as it has been said so many times, uh, ministers in this format do not negotiate as such, we don’t have the capacity to negotiate in this format. We negotiate with the institutions and the institutions, and we have been in negotiations for a long while now, and indeed when it comes to the SLA, Christine, we have come very close. It’s the rest of the package which we cannot possibly accept as it is. I explained it, I’ll explain it again. But, colleagues, nobody needs to be reminded that Tuesday is a hard deadline. As we are approaching, we’re approaching it over the last few days, it became abundantly clear to us that the institution’s basic offer to the Greek government was, uh, not sustainable for the reasons that I’ve outlined and I’ll outline again. In view of this hard deadline on Tuesday and the expiration of, uh, the agreement and the fact that we are moving into this awful uncharted territory, we called for a referendum in order to minimize the very high probability of an accident. As I said to you repeatedly, we do not believe that even if we campaigned very strongly in parliament in favor of the proposal of the institutions we would manage to push it through parliament. And then we would have three weeks, four weeks of uncertainty, so we would crash again. Again, even more certainly. Um, Alex, you mentioned disparagingly, I think, my prime minister and you said that he was, uh, referring to blackmail. That would be a terrible thing for my prime minister to have done. But then you proceeded in giving a 10-point list, I believe, then nine-point list, that could easily and fairly be interpreted as a set of outcomes from saying no to this proposal that smacks of a blackmail.",2015-06-27 00:00:00,Greece

yanis varoufakis,"My, to my Lithuanian colleague, I’ve only become a politician a few months ago and I committed never to engage in, uh, offensive statements or to respond to them. Colleagues, the reason why we are where we are, in this impasse, is very clear. Our government’s suggestion right from the beginning, which I articulated in the first meeting that I attended, was never really taken seriously. I can refer to it as the Michel Sapin principle, the principle of establishing common ground between the Mo- MOU, the existing an- MOU and our government’s priorities. For a fleeting moment on the 20th_february, we agreed on that. Let me remind you that we, it took three Eurogroups to reach the 20th_february agreement, the statement in which the MOU was not mentioned precisely for that reason, to find, in exactly the way that Michel Sapin outlined on a number of occasions, this common ground between the priorities of the newly elected government and the MOU. But since then we’ve been dragged back to the OU- MOU and we’re being told that we can choose, we can make any sorts of, um, uh, we can have any sort of accommodation with the institution as long as it is the MOU. And Christine, the let me now answer the question again, even if we agreed with the Prior Actions that you put forward to us, there is no legitimate funding package for the next five months. Ev- and, and, and even if we set up a site, which is very hard to do, what lies at the end of the five-month period? Another cliff, another negotiation, another deadline effect which unravels into the present and makes clear that the five months will be wasted from the perspective of establishing growth. There’s nothing to remove the fears of Grexit from accepting this proposal. And this is what, why we’re taking this to the Greek people. Now, and I’ll finish here, Jeroen. Allow me to submit it to you, that refusing to extend this agreement, the loan agreement, until after the Greek people deliver their verdict on the following Sunday, especially given that there’s a very strong probability, very strong probability, that the Greek people will not listen to our recommendation and will vote for the institutions’, uh, proposal, to be signed immediately. Refusing to give them the opportunity to pass their verdict will damage the credibility of the Eurogroup as a democratic union of nations, permanently.",2015-06-27 00:00:00,Greece
jeroen dijsselbloem,"Right. Colleagues. I’m going to try and come to a conclusion of this part of the meeting. I explicitly say this part of the meeting because if I think we will come to the conclusion that I have in my head, we will have to have a second part of the meeting which is about next steps. Alex and Wolfgang made that point quite early. But I think we should have the second part of the meeting. Like I said, uh, first the conclusion of this part of the meeting. I think it is very important to realize that the institutions have worked very, very hard, critically hard to try and reach an agreement within the framework of the statement of the 20th_february, which allowed for some flexibility on different levels. Institutions have throughout the process made use of that possibility, in that, putting in that flexibility. Some effectively said maybe too much and have expressed their concerns about the credibility of the outcome. There was no final decision made on that because there was no agreement. Okay, it needs to be stressed that the institutions abused taking into account also the current economic set back that Greece have used, the flexibility that was allowed. At the end of our last meeting, we stressed that the door is still open and we ask the institutions to look at the last, which came in very late, the last proposal by the Greek authorities and they have done so and if I now understand correctly, the talks continued even yesterday, even last night, until the Greek representatives at the table were called back by their government and therefore the talk stopped. That is a fair description of the process till last night. And if Yanis says, we are so close, then the question is quite fair, if so close, why walk away? Um, but the Greek government has decided pull out its people and therefore to break off the talks, however, regrettable. The government has rejected the joint position of the three institutions that was put on the table so far, uh, which is, in our minds, uh, uh, too early phase as on the technical side talks were still continuing and according to Yanis, we were so close, some question that if that’s true, if that it’s true. We never got to the final stage of the talks, which could have been, could have been today. The government rejected therefore the position of the three institutions that was on the table and put in a proposal to the parliament, which is being discussed as we speak, a proposal to have a referendum in a week’s time with a negative advice of proposals that were not finished, finalized, nor part of an agreement, certainly not complete as Michel Spain so rightly said. So it’s also fair to question what has actually been put to the Greek people, yet we’ve all said it is up to the Greek authorities. They are sovereign in their decision to call for a referendum. They must decide what they put to the people. There is some, there are some questions to be asked about the fairness of the question. So be it. Then if , if the outcome is a yes the Greek government says they will implement it immediately, but questions have been raised, what is the credibility of that? We have the experience, all of us here in the Eurogroup over the last years that programs only work if governments take ownership, and the government that has strongly criticized the program, and has put it negatively to its focus, would then implement it in that scenario, would also be a great, a matter of great concern that a number of you have raised that point. If the outcome is no, then apparently the Greek government suggest to its people that there will be a better outcome, that they will renegotiate. But given the state of play, I don’t think that is a feasible possibility and I’m listening very careful to both the institutions and to the ministers that have said already flexibility’s run out. So that’s not very feasible, uh, way to move forward. All of this, uh, in combination with the fact that the government has been so negative on the results so far, the proposals by the institutions will go to a referendum with a negative vote and listening to you, there is no ground for an extension of the program, there is no support for that. And I once again express my concern and my sadness to the fact that these talks have ended, uh, by the Greek, uh, side at this point last night, un-ended, uh, unfinished. That’s, uh, indeed as some of you have said, a sad day for the Greek people. That would be my conclusion of what I’ve heard from the colleagues. I see Michael would like to react.",2015-06-27 00:00:00,EG President

jeroen dijsselbloem,"What I would like to do is if we are uh, uh, on the same basis, if we agree along these lines, of course, I can’t expect the others to agree with my conclusion. So, uh, then we will try and draw out, I think our reasoning, uh, statements along these lines. I think it’s important to be very precise on theses conclusions. Secondly, I think we should then close this meeting with Eurogroup. I should have a press conference to make this public and we could, at a later moment, not too late, don’t worry, reconvene for an informal meeting of ministers of finance, 18 ministers of finance, that will be my proposal to talk about further steps we have to take to protect the eurozone, uh, eurozone countries and the monetary union as a whole. Of course, uh, invite the institutions to be presents, their, uh, information on preparations in these scenarios are very  agree on the text body. Thanks.",2015-06-27 00:00:00,EG President

jeroen dijsselbloem,.,2015-06-30 00:00:00,EG President
thomas wieser,"Yeah. Uh, a pure continuation of the present program, uh, in factual terms, obviously not in legal terms, but in factual terms, uh, would also, uh, not appear to be appropriate as the economic situation has changed quite, uh, dramatically. Greece would be in default, uh, the banks foreclosed, and therefore just having more of the same, uh, uh, would appear to be economically just not the right answer to this increasingly challenged situation, uh, where also, uh, the financial sector is under more stress, uh, than it was previously. So that, I would say is the background, uh, to, uh, the discussion around the application, uh, for an ESM, uh, program. Next procedural step, uh, would be your answering letter, uh, to Prime Minister, uh, uh, Tsipras, I think. That’s all for the moment.",2015-06-30 00:00:00,EWG President

So, second, without IMF involvement, we will not regard any, uh, uh, ongoing discussion. And my third remark is, in this letter we got in the meantime, from the Prime Minister, the last sentence is a declaration which is absolutely not in line, uh, with what has been the precondition, because if Greece is only, uh, committed to sell, to sell it’s external debt, in a manner  that is not, uh Greece’s, uh, del- uh, committed to sell, sell its, its external debt fully and timely, what is the precondition for any, for any even starting of thinking about.

luis de guindos,"Well, uh, you know, uh, with respect to the first letter that, uh, you know, it’s the letter that we have, uh, available, and that we can an assessment, I think that, uh, the letter requests, uh, three things from us. The first one is an ESM program. The second one is an extension of the program. And the third one is the restructuring, and re-profiling of the debt. Uh, well, the ESM program, uh, everybody, everybody knows that, uh, you know, there is a lot of requirements, and, uh, it’s time consuming. Uh, with respect to the extension of the program, I think that we all rejected an extension of the program last Saturday. I don’t know what, uh, has been modified from our stance last Saturday. And the third one, the re-profiling, the restructuring of the debt is something that is extremely, extremely delicate, as everybody knows. And I fully agree with, uh, with, uh, Wolfgang, that, uh, you know, the last sentence of this letter is, uh, is, uh, you know, totally unacceptable. So, my point is very clear, I think that this letter has nothing to do with technical, with technical aspects. Uh, I think that, uh, the person who has written that this, uh, the, the, the, the, the, the President of the Greek government, the person who has written this letter, uh, you know, uh, knows perfectly that, uh, this request cannot be, cannot be accepted by us. I think that this is a political letter. It’s setting, you know, the political stance of the Greek government with respect the referendum that theoretically is going to take place this, uh, Sunday. So, uh, uh, I think that, uh, this is the point, with respect to the second letter, you know, I am totally open to discuss, and I hope that we will be able to discuss to tomorrow, but, uh, I think that we should have a clear position with respect to the first letter, that I will be, I think that it’s not a technical one, because the things that are included here are totally impossible, you know, to accept today, but a political, a political, uh, you know, stance, that, uh I fully respect, but I think that is not our mission to assess in this moment.",2015-06-30 00:00:00,Spain

As far as the first letter is concerned, uh, request number one, ESM would take a long time, and would probably need extensive conditionality, because we’re talking about a two-year extension. Uh, then the extension of EFSF, we rejected that, and we continue to reject it. Uh, and then a restructuring of the debt, uh, ah- we are not able to discuss that at this particular moment. I agree, this is a political letter, not a technical letter, and we can discuss further, when we get a second letter, and I would also propose to do that at some stage, uh, tomorrow.",2015-06-30 00:00:00,Finland

I think, I’ve been listening to you  uh, I think so far this, uh, what you’ve said is there is no basis in this letter to reconsider our position of last Saturday, that means that the time pressure tonight is, uh, is gone, uh, also for practical reasons, I think it’s impossible to go back to the question of the extension of the program. It will expire, and any further discussion will have to be, if any further discussion, it will have to be on a, a new, uh, kind of program. Having said that, um, I think we shall, uh, await the second letter, to see whether there is a different political message in that letter, and I will set up a second meeting tomorrow, uh, after we’ve assessed the second letter.",2015-06-30 00:00:00,EG President

yanis varoufakis,"Thank you, Yarun. I would like to say that there, there are two separate issues here. One concerns the letter, the second letter. And the second issue concerns the willingness of colleagues to contemplate the logic of our request. Regarding the l- the letter, let me just m- yet again say that it has been sent. It is only one page long, because the rest of it is exactly as in the Juncker proposal for the SLA. So, um, Pierre Carlo, I understand your need to have a detailed account of our proposals, but the essence of what we are saying is, uh, pretty much as that of the institutions’ SLA, and the amendments we are proposing are no more than one page, which has already been sent. And regarding our stance on the referendum, as we’ve said, we are perfectly prepared to change that stance. On the question of, um, the last sentence in the Prime Minister’s letter, we are equally prepared to change the wording, uh, to, to being, not only fully committed, but also in a timely fashion, to service, uh, the Greek government’s debt, and its obligation to its creditors. We are also quite willing to change the wording in a way that complies with the requirements of the Eurogroup. The second issue, which I mentioned, uh, r- right at the beginning, which concerns the logic of our request, that’s a, I think the more serious issue, and this is where, uh, from what I’ve heard, colleagues are reluctant, either reluctant to have a discussion about it, or they think that this is, uh, in- that this is a difficult juncture at which to settle the issue, and it concerns, for instance, the idea of a new e- ESM program, uh, of the re-profiling of the debt request, of the extension of the EFSF, that ale- Alex, for instance, uh, and others rejected as a notion, and the, uh, presence, or absence in the new contract of the International m- mon- Monetary Fund. So it, it, but I think that, given how critical this moment is, and in view of the pressures of time, it would be good to have an opinion, separately from the, from the letter, which, as I said, has already been sent, it’s a very short letter, uh, regarding the SLA, um, y- l- why can’t we just imagine that this is not an issue, and then s- center upon the question of whether the, the, the four points I mentioned, of the logic of what we are proposing for a new program to begin from now, uh, whether they are at all palatable to colleagues? Because if that is not the case, then the second letter is neither here nor there.",2015-06-30 00:00:00,Greece
jeroen dijsselbloem,"Um, Yanis, I, I find it very difficult, and rather theoretical to discuss, uh, a second letter, or an amended first letter, or both, that I don’t know. Um, you have to realize that the practical constraints, legal constraints, and political context, there is no possibility to return to the question we answered Saturday, about the extension of the program. The program, unfortunately to say, will expire tonight. Uh, practically we cannot change that, legally, it’s impossible, given procedures, politically the context, as we speak, has not, has not changed. So, uh, I repeat that my proposal will be to have a second tomorrow, take very seriously, uh, the letter, and any second letter also, but we would have to see it first, to be able to have an opinion on it. So you can’t really ask an opinion now, on the basis of documents that we don’t have, or that you will amend.",2015-06-30 00:00:00,EG President

Uh, if the, let- let’s imagine that that, that the one page that has already been sent to Declan Costello, was in front of everyone, and you could look at it, would you still ho- be of the opi- opinion that this program needs to expire, and we should talk about, uh, our request tomorrow?",2015-06-30 00:00:00,Greece
jeroen dijsselbloem,"Yes. Because, um, uh, if undest- understand you correctly, your second letter has new detailed, changed proposals, the normal procedure would be that you would talk about these with the institutions, try to get an arrangement on the whole thing, then come to the Eurogroup, etcetera, etcetera. We don’t have the time for that, it’s simply impossible.

jeroen dijsselbloem,"Thanks a lot. Uh, welcome everyone. This second conference call in two days has the purpose to come back to the two letters that were sent yesterday by the Greek Prime Minister, one to me and one to the Institutions. Um, but I think it is enough to be  inevitable that we also reflect on the last speech by Prime Minister Tsipras this afternoon, which was again a very clear political stance. Um, the, the two letters, the first one consisted of basically two main proposals: one to ask for extension, of course we are beyond that point and we also made that clear yesterday, and secondly to start talks on a new program, new financial support from the ESF. The second letter basically said that Greece could, um, is prepared to extend the last proposal by the institutions  but with a number of changes which I will ask the Commission to reflect upon. Um, I think we need to hear from the institutions how they assess the letters but also the situation, the political situation at the moment in Greece and then I will turn to Yanis to further explain what the situation actually is. But as agreed yesterday the commission would, with the others, look at the letters first. So, Valdis  are you in the call?
– Luis Pierre -Pierre. Hi. Do you have response to the letters and how you see the current situation.",2015-07-01 00:00:00,EG President
luis pierre,"– Ok.  and we discuss that morning in the College with the agreement of the Commission today we recommend that member states fully reserve the right to make a decision once there is more clarity on the situation. Yesterday Jeroen you asked the Institutions to prepare an assessment of Greece’s proposed amendments to the list of prior actions published on Sunday. This has been done on the basis of yesterday’s letter and the views outlined, are shared, by the three institutions, but of course everybody can express opinion. Firstly I must underline  that the document published on Sunday relates to discussions on the extension of the EFSF program. Moreover  circumstances plus the last request for new two year ESM program which will involve larger financial needs means that changes will be needed compared to the reform package which was previously envisaged. Any new ESM program would of course have to be fully in line with the provisions of the ESM treaty. As a general remark on Greece’s proposals, many of them from our point of view lack clarity and specificity. So further discussions with the Greek authorities will be needed to fully asses the impact our teams have not yet have the chance to do this. 
Um, some of the individual proposals could have merit as part of a comprehensive package. Proper assessment is nonetheless required  proposal would represent a missed opportunity to simplify the VAT system, a large administration is required to administer these discounts. 
On fiscal structure measures and pensions: The government is proposing longer phasing periods for a number of measures, for example the elimination of  changes on the IKA social top-up to be credible. This could be the way we need clarity on when the reforms will be legislated and implemented . We have been open to implement it, but not the legislating the latest phase out of EKA provided comprehensive measures are found. 
On the labor market, the proposal also deviates from the proposal of the institutions, and finally on product market the letter is more specific on some reforms compared to Greece’s earlier proposals but they are less ambitious then the institution’s proposals, so more explanations should be given on proceeding with measures for example in response to the recommendation of  on the competition toolkit, we are not being able to evaluate some of proposals that have not been discussed in the so-called Brussels Group. Proposals to split DEI electricity company into separate legal entity on the state majority ownership also needs further careful strategy. 
To sum up, I would say that at first site, measures proposed will not be sufficient to meet Greece’s fiscal targets and will need further clarity of a number of the ideas in order to accept them properly, some of the measures have not been discussed properly in the Brussels Group. But there is some progress here and there, especially on the pension area, and the Commission is ready to continue working along with the other institutions on a credible reform package for Greece that reflects the changed situation. Lastly, following yesterday’s Greek request for new ESM program ,we are preparing the risk assessment proposal and we stand ready to prepare an assessment of AGBD for the ESM program when you give us the mandate to do so. Obviously the recent speech of Prime Minister, um, well tends to give also some indication on when this could be done.",2015-07-01 00:00:00,European Commission

benoît cœuré,"Υes, thank you Jeroen, and let me first to apologize on behalf of Mario but we have a governing council going on as we speak. Um, first let me agree with Pierre that the revised list of prior actions submitted by the Greek authorities is weaker than the proposals of the three institutions. So prior discussions are… around each Eurogroup, um, wants to explore  we are also aware that circumstances, that the environment changed  Benoît Cœuré
Yes? Benoît Cœuré
Can you hear me? Is the IMF in the call? Can you hear me?",2015-07-01 00:00:00,ECB

No, Jeroen, you are the solution!  -Hello?
-Now Benoit, we can hear you.",2015-07-01 00:00:00,EG President
benoît cœuré,"So, shall I continue?
 Ok. Ok. First point, the proposals are weaker than the proposals by the institutions. Second the environment has changed, um due to the further delays in the implementation of the measures. Also the damage caused to the economy through the turmoil of the last days, so these will need to be taken into account when  I would add one thing that the proposals can be explored further, but as they stand they widen the fiscal gap and also the environment around us has changed and both factors combined lead to larger financing needs and . That said we understand the discussions to finetune the proposal are still going on at the technical level and as Pierre said we stand fully ready to continue working . 
I have two additional remarks  The first additional remark is that a third program cannot be limited only to a list of prior actions so, um, the proposal of the institutions was meant to conclude the review , it was not meant to serve as a basis for an entire program. So of course, additional work would be needed to give a fully fledged, um, fully fleshed third program. And the second remark is that it is essential in our view that the Greek government commits to service all its financial obligations fully and entirely consistent with the Eurogroup statement of the 20th_february and the wording of the letter is not so reassuring in that respect, it says that the government is committed to service its external debts in a manner that ensures the viability of the Greek economic growth and social cohesion. So these would need more clarity. I stop here.",2015-07-01 00:00:00,ECB

klaus regling,"Yes of course, that I can do and yeah, we discussed this in the EWG before this call and we, I sent a letter this morning to Thomas Weizer. This is the necessary requirement mandate in non payment to the IMF, for that our board of directors can take the appropriate action. We agreed that this should happen on Friday, I recommended in my letter that we should preserve our right to call that this to be the most appropriate course of action for the next few days given the uncertainty. There is nothing in our treaty that falls on such conservation of rights, can last. We agreed in the EWG that it would be reviewed on an ongoing basis at least once a week the EWG would review it, or more frequently if necessary and I think that was the broad consensus, to move in this direction.

jeroen dijsselbloem,Yes. Yes.,2015-07-01 00:00:00,EG President
yanis varoufakis,"Ok. Thank you. Right. Let me begin with a few comments on the proposed prior actions of the Greek government which were submitted to you, which now the Institutions have had a chance to look at. I believe they were also discussed in the Euroworking Group just prior to this teleconference. We believe that the SLA changed the prior action amendments that we are proposing fall well within the maximum flexibility of the MOU process as described repeatedly to us by the institutions. Very briefly let me mention the 8 points which are pertinent here.
One concerns the discount on VAT of the islands. It is our estimate, and I believe that the institutions agree with our estimate that maintaining the discount along the lines of also what happens on island complexes anywhere in Europe including the Canary Islands and so on, that the fiscal impact will be about 340 million of maintaining this discount. We have proposed equivalent measures that pertain to tax on rents on real estate rents and also some small increase on corporate tax. The second point of difference, the second amendment, concerns the request, the requirement that individual business owners should advance immediately, a 100% of their tax payments. We have shifted that from 2016 to 2017 in order to soften the blow to them. 19:59 The phasing out of diesel tax subsidies for farmers we would like again to have a glide path leading to that in 2017.
On the question of pension reform both regarding the secondary pensions as well as EKAS, the solidarity, rather small add-on to the lowest of the low of pensions, we are again in tune with what the institutions are requesting except that again we are recommending, requesting a longer period of adaptation. As far as product markers are concerned, we‘d like to add here that the Greek government, as probably is known to most colleagues, has entered into a firm collaboration with the OECD. The secretary general of the OECD and his staff have committed to a joint program with Greece for creating, designing, implementing and monitoring the implementation of many more product market reforms and other kinds of reforms, like for instance the anti-corruption, procurement reforms and so on. And we would like these to be considered very positive steps from our government in order to pursue the reforming process, the structural reforming process which everybody wants to see being incorporated in Greece. 
Finally the, a couple more points, I won’t tire you more then is necessary, we had certain objections from the Ministry of Maritime Affairs regarding ferry transportation on security and safety grounds and finally the question of the ADMIE, the electricity sector reform where we are proposing that it be split by the  but is not privatized. This is the final change amendment that we are recommending. Again let me say that we believe that these um amendments fall well within the realm of flexibility which is part and parcel of the review process. 
Now, you asked me Jeroen to commend on the political situation. Let me be succinct on that and to the point. The referendum was called because we felt as a government that we did not have a mandate to answer the institutions’ call to accept this SLA and the particular financing package as it was given to us. We said we will put it to the Greek people the next Sunday, who are the final arbiters of such decisions. 
Again let me repeat what I said yesterday. We are fully committed and absolutely determined to implement the verdict of the Greek people on Sunday. So if the “YES” vote wins we will do whatever it takes in order to make sure that the institutions’ proposals of the 25th June, if the institutions feel like amending them, we will accept these amendments as well, will be signed, sealed and delivered within a very, very short space of time. The speech by the Prime Minister today, today, was a speech which was meant to say one thing: and that is that the concern of the government is, that whatever prior actions we undertake must be sustainable. There must be prior actions that are consistent with the reforms that Greece needs and must be embedded in a program whose financing component is giving us hope. Not just us, but to investors, to consumers, to, um, the markets, that Greece will be out of the woods in the course of the agreement that we are signing. Thank you.",2015-07-01 00:00:00,Greece
jeroen dijsselbloem,"Thank you. Before, um, asking the ministers for their  can I make few remarks. I think the question of the extension of course has passed. The old program is  therefore also the validity of the proposals that were on the table by the institutions has gone to this extent that they were meant to come to a positive review of the old program. The old program is gone and will not be finished, there will not be a positive review. Thirdly, in terms of the request for a new program, of course, as Greece is a member of the Eurozone and the ESM, it will be taken into consideration and perhaps those proposals can be then of use, and also proposal of Greek authorities can be of use. Key question now is given the political circumstances each prime minister again today whether we should undertake any action on that request at this point, or await the referendum in Greece. um, I shall ask for comments from the ministers before I say any more. Who would like to respond to the letters and the political situation?",2015-07-01 00:00:00,EG President

michel sapin,"Thank you very much. So, thank you Jeroen, I think you very well summarise the situation. There was a program that was under way and now this program is finished. So what we are talking about now, are elements for the negotiation on a future program and from this point of view proposals made by the Greek authorities are part of what can be used for that. *French from 27:06 – 27:22
Translator: On the question of what was on the table today is has the political contacts been sufficiently modified, I mean sufficiently different so as to send right now a positive political signal as to the future negotiation. Um, we have been, a number of us, have worked quite hard with a lot of contacts with all stake holders to work towards a changing, a context, a political context, sufficiently that we could have a positive political expression to the . When I’m  taking in to account the speech by Prime Minister Tzipras, with fully respecting what he said, is that it doesn’t lead to a sufficient modification of political context. So from there on, it’s not possible to have this positive expression from the Eurogroup today.
Are you finished?
I’m finished. 
Other colleagues?

speaker,"Good evening everybody. I would like to make three remarks. First of all, given the situation as described I think there indeed in this point in time, given the referendum nothing really to negotiate about. Secondly, with respect to the referendum I think that the argument that is so often repeated now that the Greek government does not have a mandate to do this negotiation is simply running away from the responsibility of an elected government. And with respect to the argument that a YES vote will be implemented by the government I repeat that I said in earlier meetings I found this to be really intolerable as a state of, um, as a state of play. Now, my third point would be that basically we are now in any case in a very different world then the one or two days ago. First of all the program has expired irrevocably and Greece is secondly, effectively in default now. Moreover, the economic and financial conditions of the country have substantially further deteriorated, not least because of the backtracking by the Tsipras government on what have been achieved under the second program. So, and I conclude, whatever’s been on the table in terms of proposals and measures need to be revisited very thoroughly in light of this entirely and fundamentally new situation. Thank you.",2015-07-01 00:00:00,Unidentified
jeroen dijsselbloem,"Thank you. Other colleagues? 
Maria Luis, may I present?
Hello?
Hello everyone. I just wanted to say that listening to what’s been said by the institutions and also by some of the colleagues, um, our position is that we fully respect the decision of the Greek government go to referendum as mentioned in the last meeting. Therefore we should wait for the outcome of the referendum before we decide what to do from there on. And I don’t know if it is necessary at this stage but I would say that I agree with the recommendation by Klaus on the reservation of rights. Thank you. I will come back to the point of the reservation of rights at the end. I believe there was a quite strong consensus in EWG on this, so maybe we can come back to it at the end.

luis de guindos,"Hello, Jeroen. How are you?
Very short, I would like to ask Yanis whether it’s correct that Mr Tsipras has said today that he supports the NO vote in the referendum this Sunday, that this NO vote means a pressure on creditors. ",2015-07-01 00:00:00,Spain
jeroen dijsselbloem,"Yanis, would you like to respond?",2015-07-01 00:00:00,EG President
yanis varoufakis,"Yes, Jeroen. We all know how negotiations unfold. We are often told in the Eurogroup, we, the Greek side, the Greek representation, that X, Y or Z parliament does not permit our colleagues to enter into a discussion about matters which are of absolute importance to the sustainability for the Greek program, like for instance, funding issues, remember the issue that I raised last week in Brussels about dipping into HFSF funds in order to pay the SMP bonds of July and August. We consider that to be highly problematic, regarding the bank recapitalization program, but we were told that a number of parliaments have prevented colleagues from even entering into such a discussion. So, the notion that a sovereign body, whether it’s a parliament or people who vote through referendum, exert pressure in the negotiations among ourselves in The Eurogroup, it’s not unheard of, it’s part and parcel of what we do and that’s what Prime Minister Tsipras said.",2015-07-01 00:00:00,Greece

Number two: Someone has already said, the new proposal, the new request, from the Greek government is about ESM program, which is, of course, as you have mentioned Jeroen, different in terms of density, features and requirements than the set of measures required to complete  This in any case whatever the result of referendum will be adds the confusion and does not provide credibility in any negotiation that we’ll engage.",2015-07-01 00:00:00,Italy

yanis varoufakis,"Yes, thank you Joreon, clearly it was. Pier Carlo, you asked what would the NO be made of. NO to what? Well, firstly, the ballot paper is very explicit. It refers to 25th of June documents that were tabled and which were offered the Greek government from the institutions, by the institutions. Our recommendation of a NO is not so much, I mean technically and legally concerns this particular set of documents which may, or may not, be on the table, but if you want me to answer in terms of the spirit of the exercise, we are saying NO to an agreement which in our estimation, and I think in estimation of many people, is simply not sustainable given the funding package that accompanies it, given the debt sustainability analysis that is accompanying it, given the fact that were we to agree to those proposals, we would have reviews every month up until November and, in parallel to those reviews we would have to have another negotiations in order to discuss a third program by the end of November. This would create an unsustainable agreement, as far as we are concerned, so we are saying to the Greek people to say NO to that. A new program with the ESM that can be agreed to on the basis of the SLA and the prior actions that are on the table as we speak, would be utterly sustainable and of course to that we would say a big YES after the referendum on Sunday.",2015-07-01 00:00:00,Greece

In response to an earlier question, why don’t we make our minds up as a government, why we are saying we don’t have a mandate, what we said, explicitly, was we did not have the mandate to sign on an agreement which we consider to be unsustainable, both in a short run and in a medium run.

So even though everything that has been said is actually correct, valid, I do feel that we owe it to the Greek people who have been mobilised in an effort to, to see Greece remaining in the Euro, to send a positive message, even out of this Eurogroup, um, in the direction, um, that we can’t initiate the process of re-examination of the Greek request. I think we should all agree that there is no way for Greece to, to technically remain in the Eurozone  a fully fledged MOU and not just a leap of prior actions, no disagreement, but at the very least we could send a positive message that the request will be examined, the process of negotiating details will be initiated, because very simply I think this will, it will give hope Greek people and it will probably help what is a common cause.",2015-07-01 00:00:00,Cyprus

jeroen dijsselbloem,Go ahead.,2015-07-01 00:00:00,EG President
yanis varoufakis,"Sure. I just wanted to say, in response to your comment, we did not put an agreement to Greek people, you are right: on 25th of June there was no agreement, but there was a very specific proposal and the time, the clock, as you were saying, as everybody was saying and I was saying, was ticking away and time was running out. We put that proposal to the Greek people, and if the Greek people say YES than we have an agreement along those lines. Now, the fact that these proposals, after we called for referendum might have been redrawn or expired afterwards, well, this is an important point. But it is not the crucial point, because the proposal that we are discussing now, the SLA, well, is very close to what was put on the table by the institutions and what we are now facing, is a prospect of a new program, which is a lot more palatable and sustainable – that Greece will stay in the Euro is a forgone conclusion, as far as we are concerned. Our position, our place in the Eurozone and in the European Union, are nonnegotiable. An NO on Sunday will mean that we are going to have to speed up the agreement, the process leading to agreement, to an agreement that is mutually advantageous and which we feel we have the mandate to see through, and which we can, look you in the eye, and say we are going to implement it. If we were going to say “yes” to proposals of the proposals of 25th of June, we couldn’t do that because we do not believe, even with the best will in the world, it wouldn’t be sustainable. And just one last point, Jeroen. Colleagues questioned our credibility when we say that in case of a YES, we shall implement the agreement. Please do not question our credibility on this. We are committed and unreconstructed democrats and if the Greek people on Sunday deliver a YES vote we shall do, as I said, whatever it takes to implement that yes, even if it means changing the configuration of the Greek government.",2015-07-01 00:00:00,Greece
jeroen dijsselbloem,"Ok, thank you. Any other comments at this point?
I will try to formulate a conclusion. I think that, after realising that the current situation is that the old program has expired, the proposals that were put on the table last weekend by the institutions, were never part of the agreement in the Eurogroup, they were never put to the Eurogroup formally because there was no agreement, Eurogroup never discussed financing needs, debt sustainability etc. That again has to be very clear. Therefore, what the Greek government is putting to its people is hard to understand. Um, the request to extend your program, of course, is no longer valid, no longer realistic. The proposal to get a new financial support from the ESM will be taken into consideration, we’ll start procedures, but given the current political situation, and as the Greek government said, its lack of mandate, we must await the referendum on Sunday.

yanis varoufakis,"I didn’t hear any of our colleagues suggest that there should be no further discussions. Negotiations, discussions… I think that, given that this government, whether the answer of the Greek people, the verdict of the Greek people, will be a YES or NO, is committed to, um, discussing the SLA, the prior actions, you have them in front of you. We heard from the institutions, that they are a positive step in the right direction, even if they are considered by some of the institutions to be weak or to contain bits and pieces which are not welcome by them, nevertheless, and also taking up what Michele Sapin was saying, it’s clear to us that it would be a good idea for everyone involved to continue finding common ground on the possibility of the new ESM program. And it just doesn’t seem to me that  of what I heard from many of our colleagues and in particular, and, if I remember correctly, Pierre Moskovici said something along the lines of what I am saying now. That we should continue to discuss and we should continue to have a discussion with the institutions, in particular to asses the fiscal aspects of what our proposals and so on and so forth.

And one more point I want to make, there is a worrying sentence in the first letter about Greece’s commitment to serve it’s external debt so I will also put in my letter a reference to what the Greek authorities agreed on on 20th_february, there the Greek authorities, in that Eurogroup statement, reiterated their unequivocal commitment to honour their financial obligations to all their creditors fully and entirely. I think it’s very important to make that very clear how we see that commitment.",2015-07-01 00:00:00,EG President
yanis varoufakis,"This is Yanis. Let me reiterate what I said yesterday in our conference that we are very happy to have this particular sentence amended as required to include timely, as well as fully, regarding the meeting of our obligations to our creditors.",2015-07-01 00:00:00,Greece
jeroen dijsselbloem," I will still reiterate it in my short letter which I will send to the Prime Minister. Thank you all, thank you for joining and we await the outcome of the referendum ",2015-07-01 00:00:00,EG President
jeroen dijsselbloem,"My colleagues, thanks for your, your patience. We are in a very difficult situation in which the stakes are high… risks are high for all of us, yet we have not come to agreement. The papers, presented by the institutions, are not proposals, so I cannot ask your, will, not ask you, to take formal position there, or on those papers. Papers that will only be relevant if there is an agreement. Um, having said that, um, after sending the papers to you for information purposes, new proposals by the Greek authorities came in. The, um, institutions that… we’ve just talked about this, uh, are prepared, uh, to look at that as quickly as possible to analyze it, to see if there are, um, let’s say useful proposals in, in that paper… Uh, useful in the sense that it makes the, the text that, uh, the commit- the institutions will be working on more credible, strengthens, uh, the text in terms of, uh, fiscal targets, in terms of reforms, etc. If that’s the case, of course, then those proposals are very welcome and will be used. Um, my proposal, or our proposal will be that, um, the institutions report to you on the outcome of their assessments of those last three proposals, uh, through the, uh, through the, your deputies in the euro working group. So I don’t expect you to wait or reconvene, or stay in Brussels, uh, you will be reported back, uh, on the outcome that last, uh, assessment, uh, through the euro working group. Secondly, um, I think the, um, the door, uh, is still open for proposals that strengthen package, or, uh, simply a positive reaction from the Greek side on what’s on the table now. Having said that, I’m fully aware that you, the ministers, have not said yes to what’s on the table now. And because I can only ask you for your formal opinion once there is an agreement. So, as always, the step will have to be the institutions and the Greek side come to an agreement, this is still possible, uh, in the coming hours, coming day, um, and then we’ll come back to you to ask, uh, your formal opinion on what then is on the table. We will then, also, uh, have to go into how we decide the financing questions, and when and under what conditions we are prepared to come back to the issue of debt sustainability. Um, what you have found in the papers are, uh, let’s say the opinion in the assessment of the institutions, but that is not, per se, what we can politically commit to, so… We will only come back to those questions if there is an agreement for us, between the institutions and the Greek authorities. That is the normal procedure and that’s the way I want to do it. Um, having said that, I think, um, in the weekend, we must be available for another eurogroup in either scenario. It could also be a scenario that there is no agreement, and then we must also, and I will say this without knowing exactly when and where, but possibly, on Saturday morning to have a euro group. To either, uh, to take stock of an agreement if there is an agreement by then, between the institutions and the Greek authorities, or talk about what needs to be done, uh, in the alternative scenario. Um, the institutions have prepared, of course, the alternative scenario, there are different aspects there… the situation in Greece, uh, our involvement and the help that we can give there. Uh, the situation in some of our countries: ringfencing, financial sector, financial markets to consider. Uh, and thirdly, the message that we give of politically how committed we are to the monetary union, and how we will strengthen it, uh, to, uh, to prove our commitment. That is also on the table right now, in the leader’s meeting, uh, where they are discussing the Five Presidents’ report. Uh, but if, uh, necessary, my proposal will be to go into those… three main topics in the alternative scenario in, uh, if necessary, an extra eurogroup, possibly on Saturday morning. I’m a little careful because I still have to report, that will also be my final point, I need to report to our government leaders and heads of state on where we are. I will report that, um, the Eurogroup has not taken any decisions, simply because there is no agreement that was put to us. We were informed by the institutions on what the possible solution could be. The Greek authorities have not agreed to it, and if they do agree to it then there are a number of political questions which still have to addressed in the Eurogroup. So, yeah, basically, um, so there are two different phases to go through, First, get an agreement between the institutions and the Greek authorities; secondly then, to get an agreement through here, in the Eurogroup, that is not a given in advance, I’m well aware of that. Um, of course, I can’t prejudge how our leaders will respond or whether they will task us to do more or try alternatives, or come to a decision, I don’t know that… until we will take, uh, that in our stride. That’s, I think, how we should move forward, so, uh, quickly summing up, the institutions will look at the latest Greek proposals and they  will inform you through your working group. Secondly, the door remains open. Thirdly, I will report to the leaders that there is no agreement, uh, no formal position by the eurogroup at this point both on the issue of the package, uh, whether it is acceptable to the Greeks and strong enough for the euro group, and the question of financing Greece short-term or long-term.  Uh, thirdly, we are ready to have a euroworking group, possibly on Saturday morning. And then, the issue will be either an agreement… if then reached between the institutions and the Greeks, or we will consider alternative scenarios on the base of the preparation by the European institutions.
