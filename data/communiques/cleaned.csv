2015-02-12,remarks by jeroen dijsselbloem at the press conference following the eurogroup meeting of 11 february 2015,"good evening. today, as you well know, we had an extra eurogroup to start our talks with the new greek colleague, to already cover some ground in advance of the regular eurogroup, which is on monday. it was the first opportunity to meet and to listen to the new greek colleague on their plans, ambitions of their government. and that was very welcome and useful. we had an intense discussion and constructive, covering a lot of ground, also making progress, but not enough progress at this point to come to joint conclusions. so, we will continue our talks on monday. on monday, we have a regular eurogroup, with a number of items on the agenda, but we will also continue our talks on greece and our current and future cooperation with greece. that is where we stand. so, there are no real conclusions, which i can share with you. you will have to bear with us a little longer. we will continue our talks on monday. and that is as far i can go, at this point. i am open to all your questions, but i am already going to say to you to be patient and i will probably repeat that five times to your questions. but i will try anyway."
2015-02-16,remarks by jeroen dijsselbloem at the press conference following the eurogroup meeting of 16 february 2015,"good evening everyone and thanks for joining this press conference after the eurogroup meeting. i will make a few remarks about other topics before turning to greece, which i understand will also be your main point of interest tonight. we discussed the request by portugal to get away to allow them to pay off some of the imf loans first of all, and i am happy to tell you that the eurogroup has lent its support in principle to portugal's plan to repay the imf loans early by refinancing at current low interest rates, portugal can make significant savings on debt service. this will off course help with portugal's debt sustainability. like ireland, which recently started its own early repayments to the imf, portugal is demonstrating how quickly a country can be back on its own two feet after a successful adjustment program, provided ownership and commitment to ongoing reforms. of course this subject will also be discussed tomorrow in the ecofin council given the involvement of the ifsm and then national procedures can start, but we hope to conclude this decision making process in the time of a month.  on cyprus, we took stock of the state of play of the program. the foreclosure framework is the hurdle right now. this framework is needed to let banks clean their balance sheets and get back to their core business of lending money to the economy, given the very high ratio of non-performing loans. so this is an important element in the economic recovery program for cyprus. if and only if this hurdle can be overcome, the program can be brought back on track. this is why we call on all involved cypriot decision-makers to implement this framework as soon as possible.  we also took stock of the economic situation in the euro zone on the basis of the winter forecast. possibly the commissioner will debrief more on that. i debriefed my colleagues on last thursday's informal european council where we discussed the state of the monetary union in preparing working towards the 4 presidents report which is now planed for june. finally, we had a discussion on the international role of the euro. this was an issue that was brought up by our french colleague some months ago and now was prepared by the commission. the euro remains important as a reserve currency, as a trade currency and as a parallel currency in neighbouring countries. at the same time, some euro area firms face extra costs when they trade in markets that use other currencies. this issue was recognized by all and even though we all agreed that the international role of the euro was and should be mostly market-driven, one can look and we will look more in depth on the reasons and possible obstacles for using the euro in international trade in specific sectors. we've asked the commission and the euro working group to look into this specific issue in more detail and then we will come back to it in the second half of this year. then turning to the greece, as you remember the outcome of the last eurogroup was that in the end we did not agree on the way forward. we have been drafting the statement but we couldn't finalize, we did not get the final agreement on that. the day after i spoke to prime minister tsipras and together with him we've agreed to ask the institutions to at least start the technical work, the technical assessment of where are we in the current program, what are the elements that the new government could agree to. there was an assumption of 70/30 - they could possibly agree to 70% but not to 30% - so we asked the institutions to look at that assumption and then to look at possible replacement measures that which would come from the new greek government's plans to fill in the 30. today we were reported back to us by the institutions how all these talks which took place on friday and saturday. in general the reaction of the ministers of the eurogroup with a slice of disappointment on the outcome of those talks. much appreciation to the people who did the work over the course of the weekend. disappointment over the fact that there was still no firm common ground on what such an adjustment in the program could look like and how much of the program would actually be carried forward by the new greek government. the last couple of days right up till the start of the meeting we also talked with greek colleagues to see whether we could find adjustments in statements on further steps and we were unable to do so at the start of the meeting. in the meeting, after we have been informed by the institutions on the state of play in the program and the 70/30 assumption, we had a round of debates on the steps forward. the general feeling in the eurogroup is still that the best way forward for the greek authorities would be to seek an extension of the program. the main reason for that is that given the ongoing discussions about how the program should work and the future arrangement for greece should look like, we simply need more time and the best way for that is to at this point to extent the current program which would then allow us a number of time, a number of months to work on future arrangements. such an extension would allow for the greeks to use the normal kind of flexibility in the program. talking to the institutions it would be possible to change measures, put other measures into place, but there would also have to be other safeguards and commitments. the request for extension would have to be accompanied by a number of commitments. let me just mention the key elements here: - yes, there is a flexibility in the program; we are open to discuss the replacing measures, but not by taking unilateral actions;    - a request to come with the commitment not to roll back any measures, unless agreed with the institutions and unless fully funded;    - a request should come with an unequivocal commitment from greece to honour all financial obligations to its creditors and off course to assure stability in the financial sector;    - on the basis of such an extended program, within which flexibility is possible should be also the commitment for the greek authorities to successfully conclude the program. we should have the reassurance that that is the intention;    - any request should be on the basis of the commitment to work closely and to continue the dialogue with the institutions and the eurogroup. on this basis, we stand ready to continue our discussions. it is now up to the greek authorities to decide whether they would want such an extension, whether they would take up the offer to look for the flexibility within the program, but also to give of the kind of commitments that i've just mentioned which are very important to all members of the eurogroup. there was a very strong opinion across the whole eurogroup, that the next step has to come from the greek authorities. they have to make up their mind to whether they will ask for an extension in the current program, as i said - using the flexibility and at the same time giving of the main commitments. in terms of process, giving the timelines that we have and parliamentary deadlines, i think we can use this week, but that is about it. if the request for an extension would come in, we would of course look at it, ask the institutions to review it and advise us and then we could have, if a positive outcome can be envisaged, the extra eurogroup of friday, but that is for the later moment to decide. that is where we stand for now."
2015-02-20,eurogroup statement on greece,"the eurogroup reiterates its appreciation for the remarkable adjustment efforts undertaken by greece and the greek people over the last years. during the last few weeks, we have, together with the institutions, engaged in an intensive and constructive dialogue with the new greek authorities and reached common ground today. the eurogroup notes, in the framework of the existing arrangement, the request from the greek authorities for an extension of the master financial assistance facility agreement (mffa), which is underpinned by a set of commitments. the purpose of the extension is the successful completion of the review on the basis of the conditions in the current arrangement, making best use of the given flexibility which will be considered jointly with the greek authorities and the institutions. this extension would also bridge the time for discussions on a possible follow-up arrangement between the eurogroup, the institutions and greece. the greek authorities will present a first list of reform measures, based on the current arrangement, by the end of monday february 23. the institutions will provide a first view whether this is sufficiently comprehensive to be a valid starting point for a successful conclusion of the review. this list will be further specified and then agreed with the institutions by the end of april. only approval of the conclusion of the review of the extended arrangement by the institutions in turn will allow for any disbursement of the outstanding tranche of the current efsf program and the transfer of the 2014 smp profits. both are again subject to approval by the eurogroup. in view of the assessment of the institutions the eurogroup agrees that the funds, so far available in the hfsf buffer, should be held by the efsf, free of third party rights for the duration of the mffa extension. the funds continue to be available for the duration of the mffa extension and can only be used for bank recapitalisation and resolution costs. they will only be released on request by the ecb/ssm. in this light, we welcome the commitment by the greek authorities to work in close agreement with european and international institutions and partners. against this background we recall the independence of the european central bank. we also agreed that the imf would continue to play its role. the greek authorities have expressed their strong commitment to a broader and deeper structural reform process aimed at durably improving growth and employment prospects, ensuring stability and resilience of the financial sector and enhancing social fairness. the authorities commit to implementing long overdue reforms to tackle corruption and tax evasion, and improving the efficiency of the public sector. in this context, the greek authorities undertake to make best use of the continued provision of technical assistance. the greek authorities reiterate their unequivocal commitment to honour their financial obligations to all their creditors fully and timely. the greek authorities have also committed to ensure the appropriate primary fiscal surpluses or financing proceeds required to guarantee debt sustainability in line with the november 2012 eurogroup statement. the institutions will, for the 2015 primary surplus target, take the economic circumstances in 2015 into account. in light of these commitments, we welcome that in a number of areas the greek policy priorities can contribute to a strengthening and better implementation of the current arrangement. the greek authorities commit to refrain from any rollback of measures and unilateral changes to the policies and structural reforms that would negatively impact fiscal targets, economic recovery or financial stability, as assessed by the institutions. on the basis of the request, the commitments by the greek authorities, the advice of the institutions, and today's agreement, we will launch the national procedures with a view to reaching a final decision on the extension of the current efsf master financial assistance facility agreement for up to four months by the efsf board of directors. we also invite the institutions and the greek authorities to resume immediately the work that would allow the successful conclusion of the review. we remain committed to provide adequate support to greece until it has regained full market access as long as it honours its commitments within the agreed framework."
2015-02-20,remarks by jeroen dijsselbloem at the press conference following the eurogroup meeting of 20 february 2015,"good evening and welcome to this press conference. we had a very intense meeting regarding a very important decision on the request for extension of the greek program. it was intense because it was about building trust between us. the trust on a basis of the agreements and changes in them that will have to be worked out. there is a hope to reach in the end a positive outcome in terms of successful review and conclusion of the program in time and that requires trust. i think tonight was a first step in this process of rebuilding it. as you know trust leaves quicker then it comes and tonight was a very important, i think, step in that process. i am glad to report you that the work that we've done over the last weeks has paid off. we have established a common ground again to reach the agreement on the statement. statement outlines the details of our agreement. i will not read it out but i will outline the main elements: - yesterday we received a request letter from the greek authorities for an extension of the mffa for 4 months. actually i've requested for 6 months, but our decision is to extend it for 4 months; - in parallel, the greek authorities also requested to extend the availability period of the efsf bonds in the hfsf buffer. in view of the assessment of the institutions the eurogroup agrees that these funds should be held by the efsf, free of third party rights for the duration of the mffa extension. these funds which are mend for recapitalisation of banks and therefore will remain available for the duration of the extended agreement and can be used for the purpose of bank recapitalisation in greece. the purpose of the request by the greek government is to allow for the successful completion of the review on the basis of the conditions of the current agreements. as mentioned in my last press conference, there is flexibility in the program, and we will make the best use of it. this flexibility will be considered jointly with the greek authorities and the institutions. it will also allow us to bridge the time for discussions between the eurogroup, the institutions and greece, on a possible follow-up arrangement in which the imf will also continue to play its role. let me recall that the formal, successful conclusion of the review will allow for the disbursement of the outstanding tranche of the current efsf program and the transfer of the 2014 smp profits. both will be subject to approval by the eurogroup, but as i said - based on the successful conclusion of the review and this is a precondition. as we concluded already in our meeting on monday, a request for extending the program needed to be underpinned by commitments from the new greek government. they are outlined, part of them in the letter and part of them in the statement upon which we've agreed tonight. i would like to stress a few key commitments: - the authorities have today expressed their strong commitment to a broader and deeper structural reform process and gave their firm commitment to, with immediate effect, refrain from any rollback of measures and unilateral actions that would negatively impact fiscal targets, economic recovery or financial stability which are the 3 key cornerstones of the program, as assessed by the institutions; - in addition, the greek authorities have reiterated today their unequivocal commitment to honour their financial obligations to all their creditors fully and timely; - on the fiscal side, the greek authorities have committed to ensure the primary fiscal surpluses or financing proceeds required to guarantee debt sustainability in line with our eurogroup november 2012 agreement. at the same time, the institutions will, for the primary surplus target for this year, take the economic circumstances into account. on the basis of these commitments given in the letter and in today's statement we will start the process which will hopefully lead to the successful decision on the extension of the program. the first step, that we've agreed together with the greek authorities, in this process is to present the first list of their reform ambitions. reform measures based first of all of course on the current arrangements, but also using the flexibility that is in the programs. this first list of reform measures should be available and presented on monday. the institutions will then provide us with a first view whether this is sufficiently comprehensive to be a valid starting point of the process which will ultimately lead to a successful conclusion of the review. so monday, to summarize - first list of reform measures from the greek side. the institutions will look at that and give us their first view on whether this is a sufficiently comprehensive as a starting point for the process which will of course in the end hopefully lead to a successful conclusion of the review. if the outcome, of course this is our assumption, of that process is positive, that will allow us on tuesday morning to start the national procedures and that will be the starting point of the formal procedure-decision making. this list of the first reforms by the greek government will later on be further specified, given details and then be assessed and agreed with the institutions, ultimately by the end of april. it can be done sooner and we would welcome it but there has to be an ultimate deadline given also the extension period of 4 months. on the basis of the request, the commitments by greece, the advice from the institutions and our agreement, we will launch the national procedures, as of next week - where needed, of course this is not valid for the all countries - for the extension of the current program. this will enable the efsf board of directors to formally approve the extension before the end of february. let me finally say that it is very important that the greek authorities, together with the institutions, resume immediately the work that would allow for the successful conclusion of the review of the next couple of month. to summarize let me say that i think this is a very positive outcome. it will allow us step by step to get the work that we have to do with greeks to get back on track. hopefully we can make a good start with that next week."
2015-02-24,eurogroup statement on greece,"the eurogroup today discussed the first list of reform measures presented by the greek authorities, based on the current arrangement, which will be further specified and then agreed with the institutions at the latest by the end of april. the institutions provided us with their first view that they consider this list of measures to be sufficiently comprehensive to be a valid starting point for a successful conclusion of the review. we therefore agreed to proceed with the national procedures with a view to reaching the final decision on the extension by up to four months of the current master financial assistance facility agreement. we call on the greek authorities to further develop and broaden the list of reform measures, based on the current arrangement, in close coordination with the institutions in order to allow for a speedy and successful conclusion of the review."
2015-04-24,remarks by jeroen dijsselbloem at the press conference following the eurogroup meeting of 24 april 2015,"good afternoon and welcome to this press conference in a quite impressive venue. let me start by thanking janis reirs for hosting us so well in riga. today we were joined in our meeting by daniele nouy, who is a chair of the the single supervisory mechanism (smm) and by the new estonian finance minister, sven sester, who also informed us about new government and their ambition. i realise that all eyes are on greece. but today was a regular eurogroup so we had a full agenda. we also talked about the situation in cyprus and in spain. we discussed the report on the ssm and exchanged views on the implementation of the recommendations addressed to the euro area as a whole. as you know, this is part of the eurogroup's thematic discussions to promote growth enhancing structural reforms. today, the institutions informed us about the ongoing talks with the greek authorities and we took stock of the situation. as agreed in february, a comprehensive and detailed list of agreed reforms is needed as a basis for a successful conclusion of the current review. i would like to reiterate again that a comprehensive deal is necessary before any disbursements can take place. over the past few weeks, there have been intense discussions between the greek authorities and the institutions. i understand that there have been recently some positive signs, but there are still wide differences to cover and to bridge on substance. we are all aware that time is running out. too much time has been lost in the past two months. it is therefore clear that these discussions need to make significantly more progress, so that the institutions can give their green light on the comprehensive package which will then go to the eurogroup for the political decision. the responsibility for that lies mainly on the side of the greek authorities. finding an agreement is first and foremost in greece's interest. i would also like to reiterate that the agreement of 20th_february remains our framework for reaching a deal. we will take stock of the situation again at our next regular eurogroup in may. today we were also joined by daniele nouy for the first eurogroup hearing, this is a eurogroup and banking union format. eurogroup hearing of the single supervisory mechanism chair. these special hearings are an important part of the way we intend to run the banking union. we have made a lot of progress in a very short time in this area. a lot of work has been done by the ssm and ecb. we are now focussing on the full establishment of the banking union on 1 of january 2016 and on the co-operation between its two pillars. we agreed the importance that member states transpose the bank recovery and resolution directive (brrd) without further delay and it is also important that member states ratify the inter-governmental agreement (iga) on the single resolution fund (srf) as quickly as possible. ministers also supported a concerted work effort on national options and discretions in order to move as rapidly as possible to a more level playing field within the banking union. our thematic discussions on jobs and growth have become an important part of the regular eurogroup meetings. today, we took stock of the implementation of last year's recommendations to the euro area as a whole in the context of the european semester. structural reforms are a key part of these recommendations. we based our discussion on the commission's euro area report. we agreed to continue and intensify these eurogroup thematic discussions. this will involve benchmarking of some policies against best practice. we also agreed on some key policy issues that we will be taking up until the end of the year. this will include services market reforms and the link between pension reforms and fiscal sustainability. we will also take another look at member states' efforts to reduce the high tax burden on labour, which is also one of the ambition of the new estonian government. the aim of our discussions is to stimulate convergence by bringing our key policies closer to best practice, by improving adjustment capacity and resilience to shocks through out the euro area. continuing on this reform-path is key to boost the recovery and to improve the growth potential and employment prospects through out our region. we were debriefed by the commission and the ecb on the main findings of their third post-program surveillance mission to spain that took place in mid-march. in which also the esm was involved. we welcomed the significant progress made by spain. all indicators are showing a progress in both budgetary and economic terms. we also realize that debt and unemployment remain high. so, clearly there are still important challenges ahead. we are confident that spain will maintain its good track record and adhere to its commitments under the surveillance framework. also on cyprus i can share a good news with you. we were informed that on 17 april the cypriot parliament legislated to establish an insolvency framework and that will also make an end to the suspension of the foreclosure framework. which if i am informed correctly is coming to place on 6 may. this framework is needed to restore compliance with the prior actions of the fifth review. we therefore welcomed this important step bringing the program back on track, which will allow the institutions to return to nicosia to carry out the next review. another important development is that cyprus lifted the last remaining capital controls on april 6th. free circulation of capital has thus now been restored."
2015-05-11,eurogroup statement on greece,"the eurogroup today took stock of the state of play with the ongoing negotiations between the greek authorities and the institutions. we welcomed the progress that has been achieved so far. we note that the reorganisation and streamlining of working procedures has made an acceleration possible, and has contributed to a more substantial discussion. at the same time, we acknowledged that more time and effort are needed to bridge the gaps on the remaining open issues. we therefore welcome the intention of the greek authorities to accelerate their work with the institutions, with a view to achieving a successful conclusion of the review in a timely fashion. the eurogroup reiterated that its statement of 20th_february remains the valid framework for the discussions. once the institutions reach an agreement at staff level on the conclusion of the current review, the eurogroup will decide on the possible disbursements of the funds outstanding under the current arrangement."
2015-05-11,remarks by jeroen dijsselbloem at the press conference  following the eurogroup meeting of 11 may 2015,"good evening and welcome to this press conference. before we start, let me briefly pay tribute to the memory of alexandre lxc3xa1mfalussy, who was often referred to as a ""father of the euro"", and who passed away on saturday, 9 may 2015. baron lxc3xa1mfalussy played a central role in the preparation of the emu as an eminent academic, as a member of the delors committee, and at the helm of the ecb's predecessor, the european monetary institute. he played a decisive role in european economic policy in later years as well, chairing the so-called ""group of wise men"" which laid the groundwork for the regulation of european financial markets. his thinking on the perspectives of the emu ranged broadly and continue to be highly relevant today. let me now turn to the subjects of our discussions today. this was a regular eurogroup meeting, so we had a full agenda. in addition to greece, we covered the number of issues regarding the economic situation and governance and discussed the positive developments in ireland.  let me start with greece, as it is in the limelight right now. today, the institutions informed us about the ongoing discussions with the greek authorities. as you have seen, we have adopted a quite short statement today in which we have recognised that negotiations have advanced. the new set-up of the negotiations which were put in place after our last meeting in riga is more efficient, more positive, more constructive, we are making faster progress. some important issues have now been discussed in depth. but more time is needed to bridge the remaining gaps and to reach a comprehensive agreement. we therefore in particular welcomed the intention of the greek authorities to accelerate their work with the institutions, with a view to achieve a successful and timely conclusion of the review. as agreed in february, a comprehensive and detailed list of agreed reforms is needed as a basis for a successful conclusion of the current review. i would like to reiterate that the agreement of 20th_february remains the framework for the negotiations and that a comprehensive deal is necessary before any disbursements can take place. we will continue to monitor the situation and we stand ready to meet as soon as the institutions confirm that there is a basis for a successful conclusion.     after our stock-taking on greece, we had a broad discussion on the economic issues of the euro area. we discussed it from three different angles: the spring forecast from the commission shows clear improvements. the recovery is strengthening, with growth picking up across the continent. there are more jobs, especially in some member states that have been suffering high unemployment. we also discussed inflation and exchange rate developments. we concurred with the assessment of the institutions that the risks of deflation have abated. but we all realise that we cannot keep counting on low energy and oil prices, quantitative easing and a low exchange rates. to keep the recovery on track, we need more investments, jobs and raising productivity. that means keeping our focus on growth-enhancing structural reforms and sound fiscal policies, so that we capitalise on the current benign environment of lower interest rates and higher growth. today, we also had a discussion on fiscal frameworks and its implementations in different countries. this was one of our regular discussions on jobs and growth in the context of the 2014 european semester recommendations addressed to the euro area as a whole. we looked closely at the experience in number of member states in implementing these fiscal frameworks, notably in latvia, ireland, slovakia, germany and other ministers spontaneously told us about their experiences. the positive news is that fiscal frameworks have been strengthened in almost all euro area member states and now we need to translate these frameworks into strong track records for fiscal outcomes. we will come back to that in july 2015 when we look at the review of the fiscal compact and then we will return to it in 2016, when the commission will provide us with an assessment of the effectiveness. so not just the legal implementation of the fiscal frameworks but also what is actually the effect of it and is it helping us in putting in place a sound fiscal policies. on the four presidents report, we had an open exchange of views among ourselves on ways to improve economic governance within the emu, making the euro area economies more competitive and the euro area, as whole, more resilient, more shock proof for future shocks. we recognized that there are clear links between what we can do in a short term given current frameworks in which we work, a lot of work still can be done within those frameworks and what we need and can achieve in the long term. this is about the need to streamline the european semester, better implementation, getting leverage on structural reforms, increasing competitiveness, deepening the single market etc. it's a broad range of views and ideas which we will make use of, when we start drawing up, drafting the report in the coming weeks.  finally, ireland. we were debriefed by the institutions on the main findings of their third post-program surveillance mission which took place couple of weeks ago in ireland. the significant progress was made by ireland on fiscal, financial, structural issues. this is notably reflected in ireland's very strong economic performance that we see right now. at the same time, some challenges remain in ireland but we are confident that ireland will maintain its good track record to tackle them. overall, ireland remains a strong example that financial assistance programs can be a real success, provided that the authorities are fully behind the program and strongly committed to reforms, as was the case in ireland. i personally would like to commend the irish authorities and the irish people for these positive achievements."
2015-06-18,press remarks by eurogroup president following the eurogroup meeting on 18 june 2015,"good evening. we can start this press conference from today's eurogroup meeting in which we have a number of issues. i will start by greece given the urgency of its situation. the eurogroup today took stock of the situation regarding the program of greece. it is regrettable to say that too little progress has been made in the talks between the institutions and greece, that there is no agreement yet is in sight. let me recall that at the basis on which we work is the agreement of the eurogroup of 20th_february and the statement that we agreed upon then. in that agreement, there were two kinds of flexibility. first, we said we would allow the institutions to take into account the current economic situation in greece and if necessary, adjust the fiscal targets and timelines considering the deterioration of the economic situation in greece. the second flexibility which we allowed was to replace measures, both fiscal measures and reforms, by other measures being put forward by the greeks after having been being assessed by the institutions. so there was also flexibility within the current mou to replace measures. the institutions have made used of those two kinds of flexibilities during their talks with the greek authorities. but as we stand now, too few measures that have been put forward and assessed are credible and serious and are to be put in a new agreement. therefore, the talks of the last weeks have not progressed. today in our meeting, we sent a strong signal to the greek authorities that it's really up to them to submit new, additional proposals in the coming days to fully engage with the institutions, within the framework of the eurogroup statement of 20th_february. as of today, it is still possible to find an agreement and extend the current program before the end of this month. but the ball is clearly in the greek court to seize that last opportunity. we feel that an agreement must be credible. it has to be credible from the perspective of sustainable finances and economic recovery in greece. but also it has to be credible from the point of view of the credibility of our monetary union and the eurozone as a whole. we think that it is still possible, but if such an agreement is sent to the eurogroup in the coming days we will judge it on that: the credibility both of greece and for the eurozone as a whole. finally, let me again stress that time is really running out. the current program expires by the end of this month, there are of course parliamentary procedures to consider. therefore, very little time remains. today we also discussed the situation in cyprus. we welcomed that the cyprus program has been brought back on track, and the prior actions have been complied with. as we have adopted a statement which will be distributed, i do not need to go into great detail. let me just emphasise that we welcomed the progress and reforms in the financial sector, including the new foreclosure framework, which is an essential step towards addressing the very high level of non-performing loans in the financial sector. important challenges remain for the remainder of the cypriot program, notably to reduce the stock of arrears. this must remain a key priority. given the overall positive picture, we endorsed in principle the updated mou and the next esm disbursement). national parliamentary procedures are now underway. we also reviewed the situation in portugal on the basis of a debrief by the institutions on the main findings of their second post-program surveillance mission. the imf participated and they call it 'post-program monitoring'. the esm also participated and the name is the 'early warning surveillance'. we welcomed the progress made and the expected strengthening of the economic recovery in portugal. at the same time, fiscal and structural challenges remain, but we are confident that portuguese efforts will be maintained. the developments in portugal and cyprus, taken together with our discussions earlier this year on post-program surveillance in spain and ireland, demonstrate a clear pattern of countries taking the necessary measures to turn around their economies and sparking growth. i think the success of the program has been proven in all of these countries. once again i would like to commend the authorities and the people of portugal and cyprus for their continued efforts, in which they show ownership and commitment to reforms can clearly pay off. we had discussions on a broad range of important issues for the euro area economy. to start off, christine lagarde debriefed us on the imf's recently concluded article iv review of the euro area. the imf sees, as we do, a strengthening of the cyclical recovery underway, but this is for a large part driven by temporary factors, so we need to keep focusing on ways to increase our growth potential and to push forward structural reforms that are needed in that sense. there is broad agreement within the eurogroup on the policy priorities identified by the fund, namely structural reforms, appropriate fiscal policies and making sure the financial sector can fund economies. in particular, one of the messages of the fund is to use wisely yields-savings stemming from unusual low interest rates. we had a discussion on this topic, prepared by the commission, and agreed that low interest rates open up a window of opportunity to consolidate public finances; invest, for example, in infrastructure; and reform our economies. it is an opportunity that we must use well. we will return to this topic later in the year. there is substantial overlap between the fund's priorities for the eurozone and the draft 2015 euro area recommendations proposed by the commission - which is part of the european semester. we endorsed these draft recommendations and we are committed to monitoring their implementation over the coming years so they will be put into our working program in the eurogroup. we must keep the reform momentum, and the eurogroup intends to keep on pushing on concrete progress and greater ownership in this area."
2015-06-22,press remarks by eurogroup president jeroen dijsselbloem following the eurogroup meeting on 22 june 2015,"good afternoon everyone. this will be a very short press conference. we have had a short eurogroup meeting in order to prepare for the informal meeting of heads of state and government which will take place at 19.00. new proposals from the greek government came in this morning. we welcomed them. they are seen as a positive step in the process. but given the very little time that the institutions have had to look at them, they were unable to give us a full and in-depth assessment. so they gave us a first impression. the eurogroup has urged them to work closely together with the greek authorities; to start immediately with those proposals, going through them, getting into the specifics, doing calculations on them and working on a list of prior actions, which is the key thing that it boils down to. all of this with a view if possible to reaching an agreement later this week, using the greek proposals as a basis for that. the work can start immediately as far as we are concerned. if all goes well, the eurogroup will have another meeting later this week to hear the final outcome of the talks with the greek authorities. those talks, as far as we are concerned, can start this afternoon, bringing together the work of the institutions so far with the new proposals, and once again with a view to reaching a final agreement later this week."

2015-06-27,remarks by eurogroup president at the intermediary eurogroup press conference on 27 june 2015,"good nafternoon. let me first make some preliminary remarks. firstly, we have set out nour conclusion in an eurogroup statement, which will be distributed to you. nmaybe you already have it. this was not agreed by the greek representative in nthe eurogroup. it was a statement by 18 ministers and you will see a footnote nmaking it clear that the greek representative in the eurogroup cannot agree with nthis statement. second preliminary remark, we will immediately after this press nconference have a second meeting to discuss any consequences from the political nconclusion just drawn and to prepare for whatever is needed to make sure that at nall times the stability of the eurozone remains at its high level. as i nsaid this morning when i came into the building, we were negatively surprised by nthe steps that the greek government took last night. first of all, if you nremember after the last eurogroup, i said that the door was still open and we nwere still prepared, and the institutions were still prepared, to look at last nproposals from the greek side and to continue talks. these talks were actually ngoing on last night between the institutions and the greek authorities when the ngreek representatives were called out and had to leave the meeting. this took nplace last night and that basically brought the talks to an end. very quickly nit was made clear why that took place. the greek government has decided to nrespond negatively to the proposals which the joint institutions had put on the ntable. they rejected those proposals and the joint opinion of the other 18 nmembers of the eurogroup is that they very much regret this, and they regret nthat last night's talks were broken off and that today no further negotiations nor talks were possible. not only the greek government rejected the last nproposals by the institutions, they have to realise that those proposals made nmaximum use of the flexibility that the eurogroup allowed in this process. we naddress those two kinds of flexibility in our statement of 20th_february. we were nprepared to take into account the recent economic developments in greece, that nthere has been major setback in the economic situation, and secondly there was nflexibility to allow the new greek government to propose alternative ways to nbring greece back onto a sustainable path, fiscally, economically, and in terms nof financial stability. the institutions, in their proposals, made maximum use nof that kind of flexibility. nonetheless, the greek authorities have rejected nthose proposals and decided to put a proposal to their parliament, which is ndebated right now, to have a referendum with a negative advice on the proposals. nthe process wasn't finished, as far as we were concerned, the proposals weren't ndefinitive; they weren't formally discussed or decided in the eurogroup, yet the ngreek government has broken off the process, has rejected the proposals and is nnow putting them, which is also an unfair way, to the greek people, to a nreferendum with negative advice. given that situation, we must conclude nthat, however regretful, the program will expire on tuesday night. that is the nlast date that we could reach an agreement and it will expire on tuesday night. nand, as i said, we will reconvene after this press conference to look at further nsteps to take, determined as we are to maintain strength and credibility of the neurozone. that is all. "

2015-06-27,remarks by eurogroup president at the final eurogroup press conference on 27 june 2015,"good evening everyone. i would like to report back to you about the informal ministerial meeting we had following the break-up of negotiations with the greek authorities last night and the eurogroup meeting earlier today. this informal meeting was held at the request of a number of ministers. we were informed by the institutions; we discussed the forthcoming expiration of the current efsf financial arrangement with greece and any consequences that may come from that. we discussed the strength and the preservation of the monetary union. coming out of the financial crisis, a lot of measures have been taken, frameworks put in place, institutions have been built, which have strengthened and deepened our cooperation, and strengthened our monetary union. we are in a much stronger position, certainly more than before the crisis. also, i would like to stress the point that all of us, euro area member states intend to make full use of instruments available to preserve the integrity and stability of the euro area, to complement any actions the ecb will take in full independence and in line with its mandate. the efsf and esm remain strong instruments with our full backing, as they have always been. we will take any necessary measures to further improve the resilience of our economy as an ongoing process. i would like to stress that the expiry of the efsf financial arrangement with greece without a prospect of follow-up arrangements will require measures by the greek authorities. the institutions stand ready to provide technical assistance to safeguard the stability of the greek financial system. the eurogroup - and that consists of 19 members, i would like to stress - will monitor very closely the situation in greece, stand ready to reconvene, to take appropriate actions when and where needed in the interest of both greece and the eurozone. we also, and this goes also for the commission and the other institutions, stand ready to support and assist greece and the greek people if and when required following the expiration of the financial arrangement with greece. this is all i have to say. the institutions will provide any technical information you want from them, on risks or possible measures. it is not up to me to communicate on a technical level."
2015-07-01,remarks by eurogroup president jeroen dijsselbloem following eurogroup conference call of 1 july 2015,"tonight we had a eurogroup conference call, following our call of yesterday. we discussed the two letters of the greek prime minister. we also discussed the current political situation in greece. first of all, regarding the request for the extension of the old program which we discussed yesterday, we reaffirmed our decision of last saturday. the political situation has not changed. there are no grounds for an extension. so unfortunately the program expired last night at midnight.  secondly there were the proposals from the greek authorities to further amend the proposals from the institutions. at this point in time we simply took note of these proposals. the main decision was that, given the political situation, the rejection of the previous proposals, the referendum which will take place on sunday, and the recommendation by the greek government to vote no, we see no grounds for further talks at this point. there will be no talks in the coming days, either at eurogroup level or between the greek authorities and the institutions on proposals or financial arrangements. we will simply await now the outcome of the referendum on sunday and take into account the outcome of that referendum. finally i can just say that i'm very sorry about the situation, given the strong determination of the greek people to be part of europe and to remain a part of the eurozone in which we fully support them."
2015-07-05,statement of the eurogroup president following the referendum in greece,"i take note of the outcome of the greek referendum. this result is very regrettable for the future of greece. for recovery of the greek economy, difficult measures and reforms are inevitable. we will now wait for the initiatives of the greek authorities. the eurogroup will discuss the state of play on tuesday 7 july.
